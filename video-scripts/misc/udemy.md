## 🎬 HeyGen Slides & Presentation Clarification

### Does HeyGen Create Slides Automatically?

**No, HeyGen does not automatically create presentation slides.** Here's what HeyGen does and doesn't do:

#### What HeyGen Creates Automatically:

- AI avatar speaking your script
- Lip-synced video of the avatar
- Background (you choose from templates or upload custom)
- Basic text overlays (you add manually)

#### What You Must Create/Provide:

- Presentation slides (if you want them)
- Graphics, charts, and visuals
- Text overlays for key points
- Custom backgrounds

### Options for Adding Slides to HeyGen Videos:

#### Option 1: Create Slides in HeyGen (Limited)

- Use HeyGen's built-in text overlays
- Add simple graphics from their library
- Limited design flexibility

#### Option 2: Create Slides Externally + Combine (Recommended)

1. Create slides in **Canva**, **PowerPoint**, or **Google Slides**
2. Export slides as images (PNG/JPG)
3. Upload to HeyGen as custom backgrounds
4. Avatar appears over your slide designs

#### Option 3: Post-Production Editing

1. Generate avatar-only videos in HeyGen
2. Edit in video software (Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve, or Camtasia)
3. Add slides, graphics, and transitions in post

### Recommended Workflow for Your Course:

```
1. Create slide deck in Canva (free) or PowerPoint
   - One slide per scene in your script
   - Include key points, graphics, charts

2. Export each slide as PNG (1920x1080)

3. In HeyGen:
   - Create new video
   - For each scene, upload corresponding slide as background
   - Position avatar (corner or side)
   - Add script text
   - Generate

4. Download and organize by chapter
```

## 💺 What Does "Seat" Mean in HeyGen Pricing?

### Definition:

A **"seat"** = **one user account** that can access the HeyGen platform.

### Your Business Plan ($720/year = $60/month):

- **2 seats included** = 2 people can log in and use HeyGen
- If you're working alone, you only need 1 seat (you have 1 extra)
- The extra seat could be for:
  - A team member or VA
  - A business partner
  - Future employee

### What Each Seat Gets:

- Full access to all plan features
- Ability to create and edit videos
- Access to avatars and templates
- Workspace collaboration

### If You Need More Seats:

- Additional seats can be purchased ("Pay as you grow")
- Typically $24-30/month per additional seat

### For Your Situation:

Since you're likely working solo or with minimal help, **2 seats is plenty**. You could even give your VA access to help with video creation.
