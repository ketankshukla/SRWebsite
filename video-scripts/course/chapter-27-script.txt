Welcome back. This is Chapter 27, and we're covering how to scale to multiple markets.

Geographic expansion can dramatically increase your revenue. Let's do it strategically.

Expand when you see these signs of readiness.

You have consistent deal flow in your current market.

Your systems and processes are documented.

Your team can handle current volume without stress.

You're running profitable operations.

You have capacity for more leads.

If you're still struggling in your first market, don't expand yet. Master one market first.

Don't expand if you see these warning signs.

You're still figuring out your process.

Results are inconsistent month to month.

Your team is overwhelmed.

You have quality problems.

You're not profitable yet.

Expanding too soon spreads you thin and makes all markets suffer.

Evaluate new markets on these factors.

Volume: Is there high foreclosure activity?

Accessibility: Are records available online?

Competition: Is the market oversaturated?

Regulations: Are they favorable or at least manageable?

Surplus amounts: Are the average amounts worthwhile?

Process: Is the claims process reasonable?

Score each factor and prioritize markets with the highest total scores.

There are three expansion strategies.

Strategy 1 is Concentric Expansion. Expand to nearby counties or states first. Similar regulations and easier logistics, but may have similar competition.

Strategy 2 is Cherry-Pick Best Markets. Expand to highest-opportunity markets regardless of location. Maximum opportunity and diversification, but must learn different regulations.

Strategy 3 is State-by-State. Master one entire state before moving to the next. Deep expertise and regulatory consistency, but slower expansion.

Choose the strategy that fits your goals and resources.

Before entering a new market, research thoroughly.

Identify the surplus funds process. Where are funds held? What forms are required? What's the typical timeline?

Understand regulations. Are there licensing requirements? Fee caps? Waiting periods?

Assess competition. Who else is working this market? How saturated is it?

Estimate opportunity. How many foreclosures per month? What are typical surplus amounts?

Build relationships. Identify key contacts at county offices.

Create a playbook for each market you enter.

Include: Market overview and characteristics. Data sources and access methods. Regulatory requirements. Claims process step by step. Key contacts. Typical timeline. Market-specific scripts or approaches.

Your team should be able to work any market using its playbook.

Consider these operational factors.

Team structure: Will the same team work all markets, or will you have market specialists?

Time zones: If markets span time zones, how will you handle calling hours?

Licensing: Do you need separate licenses for each state?

Compliance: How will you ensure compliance with different regulations?

Tracking: How will you track performance by market?

Plan these details before launching in a new market.

Here's a typical expansion timeline.

Month 1: Research and planning. Evaluate markets, choose your target, and research thoroughly.

Month 2: Setup. Obtain any licenses, set up data sources, and create the market playbook.

Month 3: Soft launch. Limited outreach to test your process and refine your approach.

Month 4 and beyond: Scale and optimize. Increase volume and improve based on results.

Don't rush. A methodical approach produces better results.

Let's recap. Expand only when current operations are stable. Select markets carefully using objective criteria. Create playbooks for each market. Adapt operations for different requirements. Track performance by market.

Your action items: Assess your readiness for expansion. Research 3 to 5 potential markets. Score markets using your evaluation criteria. Create a market playbook template. Plan your expansion timeline.

In the next chapter, we start Module 8 on advanced strategies, beginning with strategic partnerships.

See you there.
