Welcome to Module 2 of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 4, and we're diving into one of the most important skills you'll develop: finding foreclosure surplus funds.

By the end of this video, you'll know exactly where to look and how to research surplus funds in any county.

Let's get into it.

There are four primary sources where you'll find surplus funds information.

First is the County Clerk or Recorder's Office. This is where foreclosure sales are recorded. You can find sale prices, original loan amounts, and property details.

Second is the County Treasurer or Tax Collector. This office handles tax sale surplus funds. They often maintain lists of unclaimed funds.

Third is the Sheriff's Office. In many states, the sheriff conducts foreclosure sales. They may have surplus funds records.

Fourth is the Court Records system. Judicial foreclosures go through the courts. You can find case details, sale confirmations, and surplus amounts.

Let me share some free online resources you can use.

County websites often have searchable databases for property records, foreclosure listings, and unclaimed funds lists.

State unclaimed property databases are another great resource. Many states list surplus funds on their unclaimed property websites.

Court record systems like PACER for federal courts and state court websites provide access to judicial foreclosure records.

And public records aggregators like county GIS systems and property appraiser websites can help you research property details.

For more efficiency, consider these paid tools.

PropertyRadar costs about $99 per month and provides foreclosure data, property details, and owner information all in one place.

ATTOM Data offers comprehensive property and foreclosure data for larger operations.

RealtyTrac provides foreclosure listings and property data.

And DataTree from First American offers title and property information.

These tools save time but aren't required when starting out. You can absolutely start with free resources.

Here's my step-by-step research process.

Step 1: Identify recent foreclosure sales in your target county. Look for sales from the past 30 to 90 days.

Step 2: Gather sale details including the sale price, property address, and case number.

Step 3: Research the debt. Find the original mortgage amount, any tax liens, HOA liens, and other encumbrances.

Step 4: Calculate the surplus. Subtract total debt from sale price. If positive, there's surplus.

Step 5: Verify with the county. Confirm surplus funds are being held and haven't been claimed.

Step 6: Identify the claimant. Determine who owned the property at the time of foreclosure.

Step 7: Add to your lead list with all relevant details.

Let me show you how to calculate surplus funds.

Start with the auction sale price. Let's say it's $285,000.

Then subtract the mortgage payoff, which might be $195,000.

Subtract back taxes of $12,000.

Subtract HOA liens of $8,000.

Subtract legal and sale costs of $15,000.

That gives you a total of $230,000 in debts and costs.

$285,000 minus $230,000 equals $55,000 in surplus funds.

That $55,000 belongs to the former homeowner, and that's the opportunity.

Not every surplus is worth pursuing. Watch for these red flags.

Very small amounts under $1,000 may not be worth the effort given your time investment.

Multiple lienholders can complicate claims and reduce the amount available to the owner.

Deceased owners require heir research and probate, which adds complexity.

Bankruptcy filings may mean the trustee has a claim to the funds.

Recent foreclosures in states with waiting periods mean you can't contact yet.

And already claimed funds are obviously not available.

Always verify the surplus is actually available before investing significant time.

Organization is critical. Here's how to set up your system.

Create a spreadsheet or CRM with these fields: Property address, sale date, sale price, surplus amount, owner name, contact status, and notes.

Track your research daily. Set a goal for how many properties you'll research each day.

Prioritize by surplus amount. Focus on larger amounts first for better return on your time.

Update regularly as you gather more information and make contact attempts.

Let's recap. Surplus funds information is available from county offices, courts, and online databases. Start with free resources and add paid tools as you grow. Follow a systematic research process. Calculate surplus carefully and verify before pursuing. Watch for red flags that complicate claims. And stay organized with a tracking system.

Your action items: Identify 3 to 5 target counties. Research where surplus funds records are kept in each county. Set up your tracking spreadsheet or CRM. Research your first 10 properties. Calculate surplus amounts and verify availability.

In the next chapter, we'll cover skip tracing, which is how you find and locate the former homeowners.

See you there.
