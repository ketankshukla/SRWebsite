Welcome back. This is Chapter 22, and we're covering the tools and software that will power your business.

The right technology stack saves time, reduces errors, and enables scaling. Let's build yours.

Your core technology stack has six categories.

CRM for lead and client management.

Communication tools for team and client contact.

Documents for contracts and file storage.

Skip tracing for finding people.

Calling for phone outreach.

Automation for connecting everything together.

Let's go through each category.

Your CRM is the foundation of your business. Here are three good options.

HubSpot CRM has a robust free tier, is easy to use, and has great reporting. It can get expensive at scale, but the free version works well for most.

Pipedrive costs $15 to $99 per month. It has a visual pipeline that's very sales-focused and a good mobile app. It's less customizable than some options.

Podio is free to $24 per month. It's highly customizable and good for workflows, but has a learning curve.

For most people starting out, I recommend HubSpot's free CRM.

For team communication, Slack is the standard. It's free for small teams and keeps conversations organized.

For video calls, Zoom or Google Meet both work well for team meetings and client calls.

For client communication, email is still primary. Use a professional email address with your domain.

For phone, we'll cover that in the calling section.

Your phone system matters for outreach.

Google Voice is free and great for starting out. It gives you a separate business number.

OpenPhone costs $15 to $25 per month. It's a professional system with call recording and team features.

PhoneBurner costs $149 per month. It's designed for high-volume calling with power dialing.

Mojo Dialer costs $99 to $149 per month. It's another power dialing option popular in real estate.

Start with Google Voice or OpenPhone. Upgrade to a dialer when you're making 50 or more calls per day.

For skip tracing, BatchSkipTracing is popular and costs about 10 to 15 cents per record.

Skip Genie is another option at 15 to 20 cents per record.

For property research, PropertyRadar costs $99 per month and provides comprehensive foreclosure and property data.

For document signing, DocuSign costs $10 to $40 per month. HelloSign is a more affordable option at $15 to $25 per month.

Let me give you two budget options.

The Starter Stack costs under $50 per month. Use HubSpot CRM for free. Google Voice for free. Google Drive for free. BatchSkipTracing for about $30 based on usage. And HelloSign for $15. Total is around $45 per month.

The Growth Stack costs $200 to $250 per month. Use Pipedrive for $15. OpenPhone for $15. Google Workspace for $12. PropertyRadar for $99. Skip tracing for about $50. DocuSign for $25. And Zapier for $20. Total is around $236 per month.

Start lean and add tools as your revenue grows.

Use Zapier or Make to connect your tools and automate workflows.

Example automations: When a new lead is added to your CRM, automatically send a welcome email. When a contract is signed, create a task in your project manager. When a claim is approved, send a notification to you and the client. When you get a new voicemail, create a follow-up task.

Automation eliminates manual work and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

Let's recap. Build your tech stack gradually. Start with free or cheap tools. Your CRM is the foundation. Integrate tools to avoid duplicate work. Automate repetitive tasks.

Your action items: Choose and set up your CRM. Set up your phone system. Select a skip tracing service. Create your first automation. Document your tool stack for your team.

In the next chapter, we start Module 7 on scaling and cover the owner-operator model.

See you there.
