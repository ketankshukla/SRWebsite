Welcome to Module 5 of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 16, and we're learning how to close deals.

Closing isn't about manipulation. It's about helping someone make a decision that benefits them.

Let's master this essential skill.

First, let's get your mindset right.

If you've done your job well, closing is simply the natural next step. You've found money that belongs to them. You've explained how you can help. Now you're asking if they're ready to move forward.

Remember: You're not convincing them to do something bad. You're helping them recover money that's rightfully theirs.

Closing with confidence comes from believing in the value you provide.

Watch for signs they're ready to move forward.

They ask about process details: "So what happens after I sign?"

They ask about timeline: "How long until I get the money?"

They ask what they need to provide: "What documents do you need from me?"

Their tone becomes more relaxed and conversational.

They start using "when" instead of "if": "When will you file the claim?"

They mention what they'll do with the money: "This would really help with my car payment."

When you hear these signals, it's time to close.

Let me teach you six effective closing techniques.

Technique one is the Assumptive Close. Assume they're moving forward and proceed accordingly. Say: "Great! Let me get your information so we can get started. What's the best email address to send the paperwork to?"

Technique two is the Summary Close. Summarize the benefits and ask for commitment. Say: "So to recap: there's approximately [Amount] waiting for you. I handle all the paperwork and filing. You pay nothing unless I'm successful, and you'll receive your funds in about [Timeframe]. Ready to get started?"

Technique three is the Alternative Close. Give them a choice between two positive options. Say: "Would you prefer to sign the paperwork electronically today, or would you rather I mail you a physical copy?"

Technique four is the Direct Close. Simply ask for the business. Say: "Based on everything we've discussed, are you ready to move forward with recovering your funds?"

Technique five is the Urgency Close. Use legitimate time factors. Say: "The escheatment deadline for your funds is [Date]. To make sure we have plenty of time, I'd recommend we get started this week. Can we do that?"

Technique six is the Trial Close. Test their readiness before the final ask. Say: "How does everything sound so far? Do you have any other questions before we proceed?"

Use the technique that feels most natural for the conversation.

Here's a structured flow for closing conversations.

Step one: Confirm understanding. Ask, "Does this all make sense?"

Step two: Address final concerns. Ask, "Any other questions?"

Step three: Summarize value. Say, "So you'll receive approximately [Amount]..."

Step four: Ask for commitment. Say, "Ready to get started?"

Step five: Handle any objection using the LAER framework from earlier.

Step six: Complete paperwork. Say, "Let me get your information..."

Follow this flow, and closing becomes natural.

Avoid these common mistakes.

Talking past the close. Once they say yes, stop selling. Get their information and move forward.

Not asking. You must actually ask for the business. Many deals are lost because the salesperson never asked.

Giving up too early. Most sales happen after 5 or more contacts. Don't give up after one or two attempts.

Being pushy. Pressure creates resistance. Guide, don't push.

Not handling objections. Address concerns directly. Don't ignore them and hope they go away.

What happens after they say yes?

Collect their information immediately. Name, address, email, phone, and any other details you need.

Explain next steps clearly. Tell them exactly what will happen and when.

Send paperwork promptly. Don't let momentum fade. Get documents out within hours, not days.

Confirm receipt and answer questions. Make sure they received everything and understand what to sign.

Express appreciation. Thank them for their trust and assure them they made the right decision.

Let's recap. Closing is helping them decide, not manipulating them. Watch for buying signals. Use appropriate closing techniques. Follow a structured conversation flow. Avoid common mistakes. Act quickly after they say yes.

Your action items: Practice each closing technique. Write out your closing conversation flow. Role-play closing scenarios. Prepare your post-close process. Track your close rate and improve over time.

In the next chapter, we'll cover contracts and legal documents.

See you there.
