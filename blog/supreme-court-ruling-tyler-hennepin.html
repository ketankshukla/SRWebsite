        <div class="article-body">
          <p>
            On May 25, 2023, the United States Supreme Court issued a unanimous
            decision in <em>Tyler v. Hennepin County</em> that fundamentally
            changed the landscape of property rights and surplus funds in
            America. This landmark ruling affirmed what many believed all along:
            <strong
              >the government cannot keep surplus funds from property sales
              beyond what is owed in taxes or debt.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            For former homeowners who lost property to tax foreclosure, this
            ruling opened new doors to recover money that was rightfully theirs.
          </p>

          <h2>The Case: Geraldine Tyler's Fight for Justice</h2>

          <p>
            The case centered on Geraldine Tyler, a 94-year-old woman from
            Minneapolis, Minnesota. Here's what happened:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Tyler owned a condominium that she had lived in for years</li>
            <li>
              She fell behind on property taxes, accumulating a debt of
              approximately <strong>$15,000</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hennepin County seized and sold her property for
              <strong>$40,000</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              The county kept the entire $40,000 — not just the $15,000 owed in
              taxes
            </li>
            <li>
              Tyler received <strong>nothing</strong> from the $25,000 surplus
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Tyler sued, arguing that the county's retention of the surplus
            constituted an unconstitutional taking of her property without just
            compensation.
          </p>

          <div class="quote-box">
            "The County had the power to sell Tyler's home to recover the unpaid
            property taxes. But it could not use the toehold of the tax debt to
            confiscate more property than was due."
            <div class="attribution">
              — Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the unanimous Court
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>The Supreme Court's Unanimous Decision</h2>

          <p>
            In a rare show of unity, all nine Supreme Court justices agreed:
            <strong>Hennepin County violated the Constitution.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>The Court held that:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>The Takings Clause applies:</strong> The Fifth Amendment
              prohibits the government from taking private property for public
              use without just compensation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Home equity is property:</strong> The surplus value in a
              home — the equity beyond what's owed — is constitutionally
              protected property
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Historical precedent supports this:</strong> The Court
              traced property rights back to the Magna Carta, showing that
              protecting surplus funds has deep roots in Anglo-American law
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>State laws don't override the Constitution:</strong> Even
              if state law allows the government to keep surplus funds, the
              Constitution prohibits it
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>What This Means for Homeowners</h2>

          <p>
            The Tyler decision has significant implications for anyone who has
            lost property to foreclosure:
          </p>

          <h3>Strengthened Rights to Surplus Funds</h3>
          <p>
            The ruling makes clear that former homeowners have a constitutional
            right to surplus funds from property sales. Government entities
            cannot simply pocket the excess.
          </p>

          <h3>Applies to Tax Sales Nationwide</h3>
          <p>
            While the case specifically involved Minnesota, the constitutional
            principles apply across all 50 states. Any state law that allows
            governments to keep surplus funds is now constitutionally suspect.
          </p>

          <h3>Potential for Retroactive Claims</h3>
          <p>
            Some former homeowners may be able to pursue claims for surplus
            funds that were improperly retained in past years, depending on
            state statutes of limitations.
          </p>

          <h3>Increased Scrutiny of Foreclosure Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Counties and municipalities are now under greater pressure to
            properly account for and distribute surplus funds to former property
            owners.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              <strong>Important:</strong> While Tyler v. Hennepin specifically
              addressed tax foreclosures, the constitutional principles
              regarding property rights and surplus funds apply broadly to all
              types of foreclosure sales.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Problem of "Home Equity Theft"</h2>

          <p>
            Before the Tyler decision, the practice of governments keeping
            surplus funds was sometimes called "home equity theft." The scope of
            the problem was staggering:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A Pacific Legal Foundation study found that between 2014 and 2021,
              over <strong>8,900 homes</strong> were taken through tax
              foreclosure where the government kept the surplus
            </li>
            <li>
              The total value of equity taken exceeded
              <strong>$280 million</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              At least <strong>12 states</strong> had laws allowing this
              practice
            </li>
            <li>
              The victims were often elderly, disabled, or low-income homeowners
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Tyler ruling effectively declared this practice
            unconstitutional.
          </p>

          <h2>States Affected by the Ruling</h2>

          <p>
            Before Tyler, the following states had laws that allowed governments
            to keep surplus funds from tax sales:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Alabama</li>
            <li>Arizona</li>
            <li>Colorado</li>
            <li>Illinois</li>
            <li>Maine</li>
            <li>Massachusetts</li>
            <li>Minnesota</li>
            <li>Montana</li>
            <li>Nebraska</li>
            <li>New Jersey</li>
            <li>New York</li>
            <li>Oregon</li>
            <li>South Dakota</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These states must now reform their practices to comply with the
            Supreme Court's ruling.

          <h2>What Happens Now?</h2>

          <p>Following the Tyler decision:</p>

          <h3>States Are Changing Laws</h3>
          <p>
            Many states are revising their tax foreclosure statutes to ensure
            surplus funds are returned to former property owners.
          </p>

          <h3>Counties Are Updating Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            Local governments are implementing new processes to identify, track,
            and distribute surplus funds.
          </p>

          <h3>Former Owners Are Filing Claims</h3>
          <p>
            People who lost property to tax foreclosure are now pursuing claims
            for surplus funds that were improperly retained.
          </p>

          <h3>Litigation Continues</h3>
          <p>
            Class action lawsuits and individual claims are being filed against
            counties that kept surplus funds in violation of property owners'
            rights.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Claim Your Surplus Funds</h2>

          <p>
            If you lost property to a tax foreclosure and believe surplus funds
            were retained by the government:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Determine the sale price:</strong> Find out how much your
              property sold for at auction
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Calculate the surplus:</strong> Subtract the taxes owed,
              fees, and costs from the sale price
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contact the county:</strong> Reach out to the county
              treasurer or tax collector about claiming surplus funds
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check for time limits:</strong> Some states have deadlines
              for filing claims
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider legal help:</strong> For complex cases or if your
              claim is denied, professional assistance may be valuable
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>
            The Tyler v. Hennepin County decision represents a major victory for
            property rights in America. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed
            that the government cannot use a tax debt as an excuse to confiscate
            a homeowner's entire equity.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you lost property to foreclosure — especially tax foreclosure —
            and didn't receive surplus funds from the sale, you may have a valid
            claim. The Constitution is now clearly on your side.
          </p>

          <p>
            Don't let your money sit unclaimed. Take action to recover what's
            rightfully yours.
