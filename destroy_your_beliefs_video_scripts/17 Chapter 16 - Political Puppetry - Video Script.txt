How did you decide your political beliefs?

Most people think they reasoned their way to their positions. But research tells a different story.

Political beliefs are mostly tribal. We pick a team—often based on family, geography, or social group—and then we defend that team. We're not rational analysts. We're fans.

And powerful people know how to pull our strings.

Here's how political manipulation works.

First, fear. Politicians and media know that fear bypasses rational thinking. Fear of immigrants. Fear of crime. Fear of the other side winning. When you're scared, you don't think carefully—you react. And that reaction can be directed.

Second, identity. Politics isn't really about policy for most people. It's about belonging. "Us versus them." Once you identify with a political tribe, attacking your side feels like a personal attack. You defend your team even when they're wrong.

Third, media ecosystems. News outlets and social media algorithms are designed to engage you—and outrage is engaging. You end up in a bubble where you only see information that confirms what you already believe. The other side seems not just wrong, but evil or stupid.

The result? We become political puppets. Our strings are pulled by people who understand our psychology better than we do.

Think about it. When's the last time you changed your mind on a political issue because of evidence? When's the last time you seriously considered the other side's best arguments?

If you're like most people, it's been a while.

So how do you cut the strings?

First, recognize that you're being manipulated. Every political message is designed to make you feel something—usually fear or anger. Notice when that's happening.

Second, seek out the strongest arguments against your positions. Not the strawman versions—the real ones. If you can't articulate why smart, good-faith people disagree with you, you don't understand the issue.

Third, separate identity from policy. You can change your mind on an issue without changing who you are. Your political tribe doesn't define you.

Fourth, focus on outcomes, not teams. Ask: "What actually works?" instead of "What does my side say?"

This doesn't mean becoming apolitical. Engagement matters. But you can engage thoughtfully instead of tribally.

The goal isn't to have no political views. It's to have views that are actually yours—not ones that were installed by people who benefit from your outrage.

In the next video, we'll examine one of the most powerful tribal identities of all: nationalism.
