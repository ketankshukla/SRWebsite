Inherited Delusions
The Beliefs You Never Chose

Welcome back. Today we're exploring something that shapes your life more than almost anything else—yet you probably never chose it, never questioned it, and might not even know it exists.

I'm talking about inherited delusions: the beliefs, assumptions, and worldviews you absorbed from your family, your culture, and your environment before you were old enough to think critically about them.

These aren't beliefs you chose. They're beliefs that were installed in you, like software on a computer. And just like software, they run in the background, shaping everything you do—whether you're aware of them or not.

Let me ask you some questions.

What do you believe about money? Is it evil, or is it a tool? Is wanting more of it greedy, or ambitious? Should you save it carefully, or spend it freely?

What do you believe about success? Is it about wealth, or happiness? Is it achieved through hard work, or connections? Is it something you pursue individually, or something you build with others?

What do you believe about relationships? Should you marry young, or wait? Should you prioritize passion, or stability? What roles should partners play?

What do you believe about yourself? Are you smart, or not? Creative, or practical? A leader, or a follower? Destined for greatness, or meant for a quiet life?

Now here's the real question: Where did these beliefs come from?

If you're honest, most of them came from your family. From things your parents said, or didn't say. From what was rewarded and what was punished. From the unspoken assumptions that filled your childhood home.

And your parents got their beliefs from their parents, who got them from their parents, stretching back through generations. You're carrying beliefs that might be centuries old—beliefs formed in completely different circumstances, for completely different reasons.

These inherited beliefs aren't necessarily wrong. Some of them might serve you well. But the problem is that you never chose them. You never examined them. You never asked whether they fit your life, your circumstances, your values.

They're running your life, and you didn't even install them.

Let's look at some common inherited delusions.

The first is beliefs about gender roles.

What should men do? What should women do? How should they behave, what should they want, what roles should they play in families and society?

These beliefs vary enormously across cultures and time periods. What seems "natural" in one society would be unthinkable in another. Yet within any given culture, these beliefs feel obvious, inevitable, like they're just the way things are.

If you grew up being told that men should be providers and women should be nurturers, that belief probably feels natural to you. But it's not natural—it's cultural. It's inherited. And it might be limiting your life in ways you don't even recognize.

Maybe you're a man who would thrive in a nurturing role but feels shame about wanting it. Maybe you're a woman who wants to focus on career but feels guilty about it. These feelings aren't coming from reality—they're coming from inherited beliefs that may not fit who you actually are.

The second common inherited delusion is beliefs about career and success.

What counts as a "good" job? What does success look like? How much should you sacrifice for your career?

In some families, success means becoming a doctor or lawyer. In others, it means running your own business. In others, it means having a stable job with good benefits. In others, it means pursuing your passion regardless of income.

None of these definitions is objectively correct. They're all cultural constructs, passed down through families and communities. But if you absorbed one of them as a child, it probably feels like the obvious truth.

How many people are pursuing careers they don't want because their inherited definition of success demands it? How many are feeling like failures despite objectively good lives, because they don't match their family's template?

The third inherited delusion is beliefs about money.

Is money good or bad? Is wanting it virtuous or shameful? Should you spend freely or save carefully? Is wealth a sign of success or a source of corruption?

These beliefs are often deeply emotional, tied to family experiences with money—abundance or scarcity, generosity or conflict, security or anxiety.

If your family struggled with money, you might have inherited beliefs about scarcity—that there's never enough, that you have to hold on tight, that spending is dangerous. These beliefs might have been adaptive for your parents' situation, but they might be limiting you in a completely different economic reality.

If your family had money but conflict around it, you might have inherited beliefs that money causes problems—that it's better to avoid wealth, that wanting money is shameful. These beliefs might be keeping you from financial success that would actually improve your life.

The fourth inherited delusion is beliefs about relationships and love.

What does a good relationship look like? How should partners treat each other? What's worth fighting about, and what should be let go? When should you stay, and when should you leave?

These beliefs are often absorbed by watching your parents' relationship—or their divorces, their conflicts, their silences. You learned what "normal" looks like before you could evaluate whether that normal was healthy.

If your parents had a volatile relationship, you might believe that love involves drama and conflict. If they had a distant relationship, you might believe that emotional intimacy is unrealistic. If they stayed together despite being unhappy, you might believe that's what commitment means.

These inherited templates shape who you're attracted to, how you behave in relationships, and what you tolerate. They're often invisible—you just think you're following your heart, when really you're following your programming.

The fifth inherited delusion is beliefs about yourself.

Are you smart? Capable? Worthy of love and success? Do you have what it takes?

These beliefs often come from early messages—explicit or implicit—about who you are and what you can expect from life.

If you were told you were smart, you probably believe it. If you were told you were difficult, you probably believe that too. If your family expected great things from you, you might feel driven—or crushed by pressure. If they expected nothing, you might feel free—or abandoned.

These early messages become self-concepts, and self-concepts become self-fulfilling prophecies. You act in accordance with who you believe you are, which produces results that confirm the belief.

The child who was told they were bad at math avoids math, doesn't develop math skills, and "proves" they were right. The child who was told they were a natural leader seeks leadership roles, develops leadership skills, and "proves" they were right.

But these weren't discoveries about fixed traits. They were beliefs that created the reality they described.

So how do we identify and question our inherited delusions?

The first step is awareness.

Start noticing your automatic beliefs—especially the ones that feel obviously true. When something feels like "just the way things are," that's often a sign of an inherited belief rather than an objective fact.

Ask yourself: Where did this belief come from? Did I choose it, or did I absorb it? Would someone from a different family or culture see this as obviously true?

The second step is examining the source.

Think about your family's beliefs and how they might have shaped yours. What did your parents believe about money, success, relationships, gender, and identity? What was rewarded in your household? What was punished or discouraged?

You don't have to blame your parents—they were passing on what they inherited, doing the best they could with what they had. But you do need to see clearly what you absorbed from them.

The third step is evaluating fit.

Ask yourself: Does this belief serve me? Does it fit my life, my circumstances, my values? Or is it a hand-me-down that doesn't quite fit?

A belief that served your parents in their time and place might not serve you in yours. A belief that made sense for their generation might be outdated for yours. A belief that fit their personality might not fit yours.

The fourth step is conscious choice.

Once you've identified an inherited belief and evaluated its fit, you can make a conscious choice about whether to keep it. You might decide the belief serves you well and choose to embrace it intentionally. Or you might decide it doesn't fit and choose to let it go.

The key is that now it's your choice. You're no longer running on autopilot, following programming you never installed.

The fifth step is patience.

Inherited beliefs are deeply rooted. You can't just decide to change them and have them instantly disappear. They'll keep showing up, especially under stress.

The work is ongoing—noticing when old beliefs arise, choosing not to act on them, gradually building new patterns. It takes time, but it's possible.

Breaking free from inherited delusions doesn't mean rejecting everything you learned from your family. Some of what you inherited is valuable and worth keeping. The goal isn't to throw everything out—it's to examine everything consciously and keep what serves you.

It also doesn't mean blaming your family. They gave you what they had, which was shaped by what they received. The chain of inheritance stretches back through generations. Understanding this can foster compassion rather than resentment.

What it does mean is taking responsibility for your beliefs going forward. You didn't choose what was installed, but you can choose what you run. You can examine your programming, update what's outdated, and delete what's harmful.

You are not your inherited beliefs. You are the awareness that can observe them, question them, and choose whether to keep them.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the fallacy of faith—how blind trust, whether in religion, politics, or relationships, can lead us astray. We'll distinguish between healthy faith and dangerous faith, and learn how to trust wisely.

But for now, I want you to identify one inherited belief that might be limiting your life. One assumption you absorbed from your family that you've never really questioned.

And I want you to question it. Not necessarily to reject it—but to hold it up to the light and see it clearly for the first time.

Because the beliefs you never chose might be the ones most worth examining.
