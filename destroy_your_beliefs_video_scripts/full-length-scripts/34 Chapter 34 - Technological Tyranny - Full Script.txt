Technological Tyranny
Reclaiming Our Humanity in a Digital Age

Welcome back. Today we're examining our relationship with technology—and whether we're in control of it, or it's in control of us.

Think about your relationship with your phone. How many times do you check it daily? Can you go an hour without it? Do you reach for it automatically?

We've become tethered to our devices in ways that would have seemed dystopian a generation ago. And it's by design.

Tech companies employ engineers whose job is to capture your attention. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every variable reward is engineered to keep you engaged.

The costs are real. Attention fragmentation makes deep work rare. Social media distorts our view of reality. Mental health impacts are mounting. Work invades all of life. Surveillance has become normalized.

So what do you do?

Set boundaries. Turn off notifications. Set time limits. Protect phone-free times and spaces.

Be intentional. Use technology for specific purposes, not as a default activity.

Protect attention. Your attention is valuable—guard it.

Question defaults. Just because a feature exists doesn't mean you should use it.

Demand better. Push for technology that serves human flourishing rather than exploiting human psychology.

Technology isn't going away. But you can reclaim your relationship with it.

In the next chapter, we'll examine the productivity trap.
