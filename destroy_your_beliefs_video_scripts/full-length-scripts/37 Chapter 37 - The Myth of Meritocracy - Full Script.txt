The Myth of Meritocracy
Confronting Systemic Inequalities

Welcome back. Today we're examining the meritocracy myth—the belief that success comes from talent and hard work alone.

Your birth circumstances have enormous effects on your life outcomes. A child born to wealthy, educated parents has completely different opportunities than one born into poverty.

Even within one society, the playing field isn't level. Quality of schools varies. Access to healthcare varies. Social networks vary. Discrimination is real.

And luck plays a huge role. Being in the right place at the right time. Meeting the right person. Successful people often attribute to merit what was largely luck.

The meritocracy belief has real consequences. Successful people become arrogant. Struggling people blame themselves. Inequality gets justified.

So what's a more honest view?

Acknowledge both agency and structure. Your choices matter—but so do circumstances you didn't choose.

Recognize your advantages. If you've succeeded, honestly assess how much was merit and how much was luck.

Have compassion for those struggling. Their situation often reflects circumstances, not character.

Support genuine equality of opportunity. If we actually believed in meritocracy, we'd work much harder to level the playing field.

The myth of meritocracy prevents us from creating actual meritocracy.

In the next chapter, we'll examine environmental beliefs.
