The Health Hype
Navigating Wellness Misinformation

Welcome back. Today we're cutting through the noise in health and wellness—an area saturated with misinformation.

Diet trends come and go. Low-fat, low-carb, paleo, keto, intermittent fasting—each promised to be the answer. The reality? Nutrition science is complicated. The dramatic claims rarely match the evidence.

Supplements are mostly unnecessary. Unless you have a specific deficiency, most don't help—and some may harm.

"Natural" doesn't mean safe or effective. Many alternative therapies lack scientific support.

Even mainstream medicine isn't perfect. Recommendations change. Conflicts of interest exist.

So how do you navigate this?

Be skeptical of dramatic claims. Real health improvements are usually gradual.

Look for scientific consensus, not single studies.

Watch for red flags. Miracle cures. Secret knowledge. Testimonials instead of data.

Focus on fundamentals. Sleep, movement, nutrition, stress management, social connection. These matter more than any supplement.

Accept uncertainty. We don't have all the answers. Anyone claiming certainty is probably selling something.

Your body isn't a machine to be optimized with hacks. It's a complex system that mostly needs basics done consistently.

In the next chapter, we'll reimagine education.
