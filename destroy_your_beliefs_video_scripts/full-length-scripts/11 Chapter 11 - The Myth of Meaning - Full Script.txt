The Myth of Meaning
Creating Purpose in a Purposeless Universe

Welcome back. Today we're exploring perhaps the most fundamental question humans ask: What is the meaning of life?

This question has haunted humanity since we first became conscious enough to ask it. Every religion, every philosophy, every culture has offered answers. And most of those answers share a common assumption: that meaning exists out there, waiting to be discovered.

But what if that assumption is wrong? What if the universe has no inherent meaning, no built-in purpose, no cosmic plan? What if meaning is something we create rather than something we find?

This might sound depressing. But stay with me—because I think it's actually liberating.

Let's start with the traditional view.

For most of human history, people believed that meaning came from outside themselves. God had a plan. The universe had a purpose. Your life had a destiny. Your job was to discover that meaning and align yourself with it.

This view is comforting. It suggests that your life matters in some cosmic sense, that your suffering has a reason, that everything will work out according to a higher plan.

But it also has problems.

First, there's no evidence for it. Despite millennia of searching, no one has produced convincing proof that the universe has inherent meaning or that a cosmic plan exists. The belief persists because it's comforting, not because it's supported.

Second, it creates dependency. If meaning comes from outside you, then you're dependent on that external source. You have to figure out what the plan is and follow it. You can't create your own meaning—you can only discover the meaning that's been assigned to you.

Third, it leads to existential crisis when challenged. If you've built your life on the belief that meaning is given, what happens when that belief is shaken? Many people experience profound despair when they lose faith in cosmic meaning.

Now let's consider the alternative view.

What if the universe is exactly what it appears to be—vast, ancient, and indifferent? What if there's no cosmic plan, no inherent purpose, no meaning built into the fabric of reality?

This is the view suggested by modern science. The universe operates according to physical laws that don't care about human concerns. We're the product of billions of years of evolution—a process driven by survival and reproduction, not by purpose or meaning.

From this perspective, the search for inherent meaning is like searching for the edge of a flat earth. You can search forever, but you won't find it because it doesn't exist.

But here's where it gets interesting.

The absence of inherent meaning doesn't mean the absence of meaning. It means that meaning is something we create rather than something we discover.

Think about it. What gives your life meaning right now? Probably things like relationships, work you care about, experiences you value, contributions you make. These things are meaningful to you—not because the universe declared them meaningful, but because you experience them as meaningful.

That meaning is real. It's just not cosmic. It's human.

The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called this "existence precedes essence." We exist first, and then we create our essence—our meaning, our purpose, our identity—through our choices and actions.

This is both terrifying and liberating.

It's terrifying because there's no script to follow. No one is going to tell you what your life means. You can't look it up or pray for guidance and receive a clear answer. The responsibility is entirely yours.

But it's liberating because you're free. You're not bound by a predetermined purpose. You're not failing if you don't discover some hidden meaning. You get to decide what matters, what to pursue, what your life is about.

Let me give you some examples of how people create meaning.

Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist who survived the Nazi concentration camps. In his book "Man's Search for Meaning," he described how even in the most horrific circumstances, people who found meaning—in love, in work, in suffering itself—were more likely to survive.

Frankl didn't claim that the camps had inherent meaning. They were senseless atrocities. But he observed that humans can create meaning even in meaninglessness. The meaning doesn't come from the situation—it comes from how we respond to it.

Consider the meaning people find in relationships. The love between partners, the bond between parent and child, the loyalty between friends—these connections are profoundly meaningful. But that meaning isn't inscribed in the cosmos. It's created through the relationship itself.

Consider the meaning people find in work. A teacher finds meaning in educating young minds. A doctor finds meaning in healing the sick. An artist finds meaning in creating beauty. This meaning is real and valuable—but it's not given by the universe. It's created by the person doing the work.

Consider the meaning people find in contribution. Helping others, building something that outlasts you, making the world a little better—these create meaning. Not because the universe cares, but because you care.

So how do we create meaning in a meaningless universe?

The first step is accepting the situation.

Stop searching for meaning that's hidden somewhere, waiting to be discovered. Accept that if your life is going to have meaning, you're going to have to create it.

This acceptance can be difficult. It means giving up the comfort of cosmic significance. But it also means taking responsibility for your own life.

The second step is choosing your values.

What matters to you? Not what should matter according to society or tradition or religion—what actually matters to you, when you're honest with yourself?

These values become the foundation for meaning. When you live in accordance with your values, life feels meaningful. When you violate them, it feels empty.

The third step is engaging with life.

Meaning isn't found in passive contemplation. It's created through action, through engagement, through commitment. The more fully you engage with life—with work, with relationships, with challenges—the more meaning you create.

This is why people who are busy with things they care about rarely worry about the meaning of life. They're too busy living meaningfully to ask the question.

The fourth step is accepting impermanence.

The meaning you create is temporary. It won't last forever. Eventually, you'll die, and everything you've built will fade.

This might seem to undermine meaning. If it's all temporary, what's the point?

But impermanence doesn't negate meaning—it intensifies it. A beautiful sunset isn't less beautiful because it fades. A loving relationship isn't less meaningful because it will end. The temporary nature of things makes them precious, not pointless.

The fifth step is connecting with others.

Meaning is often relational. It's created in connection with other people, in contribution to something larger than yourself. Isolated meaning is thin; connected meaning is rich.

This is why community, family, and friendship are so important to well-being. They're not just nice to have—they're central to creating a meaningful life.

Now, I want to address a common objection.

Some people say that if meaning is created rather than discovered, it's not "real" meaning. It's just a comforting illusion we tell ourselves.

But this objection doesn't hold up. Why would created meaning be less real than discovered meaning? The experience of meaning is the same either way. The effects on your life are the same. The only difference is the source—and why should the source matter more than the experience?

In fact, created meaning might be more authentic than discovered meaning. When you create your own meaning, it's genuinely yours. When you follow a meaning that was given to you, you might be living someone else's life.

Another objection is that without cosmic meaning, nothing ultimately matters. In the long run, the sun will burn out, the universe will end, and everything will be forgotten.

This is true. But "ultimately" is a strange standard to apply to human life. We don't live in the ultimate long run—we live in the present, in our brief span of consciousness. What matters is what matters to us, now, in the lives we're actually living.

The fact that the universe will eventually end doesn't make your love less real, your work less valuable, or your experiences less meaningful. It just means that meaning is a human phenomenon, not a cosmic one.

In the next chapter, we'll explore identity—the story you tell yourself about who you are. We'll see how this story is constructed, how it can limit you, and how you can rewrite it.

But for now, I want you to sit with this question: What gives your life meaning?

Not what should give it meaning. Not what you've been told should matter. What actually makes your life feel meaningful when you're living it?

That's your meaning. You created it. It's real.

And the fact that you created it doesn't make it less valuable. It makes it yours.

The universe doesn't care about you. But you can care about things. And that caring, that meaning-making, that's what makes human life remarkable.

We're meaning-creating creatures in a meaningless universe. That's not a tragedy. It's a superpower.

Use it well.
