Nationalistic Nonsense
Transcending Tribal Boundaries

Welcome back. Today we're examining one of the most powerful forces shaping human behavior: nationalism.

National identity runs deep. People feel pride in their country, loyalty to their fellow citizens, and often a sense that their nation is special—perhaps even superior to others. These feelings are so strong that people will kill and die for their nation.

But where does nationalism come from? Is it natural and inevitable? Or is it a constructed belief system that might be limiting us?

Let's examine this honestly.

First, let's understand what nationalism is.

Nationalism is the belief that the nation is the fundamental unit of human identity and political organization. It holds that people who share a national identity—usually defined by language, culture, history, or ethnicity—should be united in a state, and that loyalty to this nation should take priority over other loyalties.

This seems natural to us because we've grown up in a world organized around nation-states. But this organization is actually quite recent in human history.

For most of human existence, people identified primarily with their family, their village, their tribe, their religion, or their lord—not with a nation. The nation-state as we know it emerged mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries.

National identities were deliberately constructed. Governments created national education systems that taught shared languages and histories. They created national symbols, holidays, and rituals. They promoted narratives of national greatness and destiny.

This construction was often violent. National borders were drawn through wars and conquests. Diverse populations were forced into national molds. Minorities who didn't fit the national identity were marginalized, expelled, or killed.

The nations we take for granted today are the products of this historical process—not natural categories but human constructions.

Second, let's examine the arbitrariness of national identity.

National borders are largely accidents of history. They were drawn by colonial powers, determined by wars, negotiated in treaties. There's nothing natural or inevitable about where one nation ends and another begins.

The "national character" that supposedly defines different peoples is largely a myth. There's more variation within nations than between them. The stereotypes we hold about different nationalities are oversimplifications at best, prejudices at worst.

National histories are selective narratives. Every nation emphasizes its glorious moments and downplays its atrocities. The history you learned in school was designed to make you feel a certain way about your country—not to give you an accurate picture of the past.

If you had been born in a different country, you would feel the same loyalty and pride toward that country. Your national identity isn't a discovery about who you really are—it's a product of where you happened to be born.

Third, let's examine the costs of nationalism.

Nationalism has been the cause of immense suffering. Wars between nations have killed hundreds of millions. Genocides have been committed in the name of national purity. Minorities have been persecuted for not fitting the national mold.

Even in peacetime, nationalism has costs. It creates in-groups and out-groups, fostering suspicion and hostility toward foreigners. It makes international cooperation more difficult, even when cooperation is clearly in everyone's interest.

Climate change is a perfect example. This is a global problem that requires global solutions. But nationalism makes countries prioritize their own short-term interests over collective long-term well-being. The result is inadequate action on an existential threat.

Nationalism also distorts our moral thinking. We care more about suffering in our own country than suffering elsewhere, even though suffering is suffering regardless of where it occurs. We accept policies that benefit our nation at the expense of others, even when those policies cause greater harm than good overall.

Fourth, let's acknowledge what nationalism provides.

Nationalism isn't just a source of problems. It also provides real benefits.

It creates community and belonging. In a world of increasing atomization, national identity gives people a sense of connection to something larger than themselves.

It provides meaning and purpose. National narratives give people a sense of participating in a grand historical project, of contributing to something that will outlast them.

It enables collective action. Nations can mobilize resources and coordinate efforts in ways that smaller units cannot. Many of the achievements we value—from infrastructure to social programs to scientific research—have been accomplished through national institutions.

It provides security. In a world of competing powers, national defense protects citizens from external threats. International cooperation is valuable, but it hasn't replaced the need for national security.

So the question isn't whether to have any national identity, but how to hold it.

The problem isn't feeling connected to your country. The problem is when that connection becomes exclusive, when it leads to hostility toward others, when it blinds you to your nation's faults, when it prevents necessary cooperation.

How do we hold national identity more skillfully?

First, recognize its constructed nature. Your national identity isn't a discovery about your essence—it's a product of where you were born and how you were raised. This recognition allows you to hold it more lightly.

Second, acknowledge your nation's faults. Every nation has committed atrocities, made mistakes, fallen short of its ideals. Acknowledging this isn't disloyalty—it's honesty. And it's necessary for improvement.

Third, extend your circle of concern. You can care about your fellow citizens while also caring about people in other countries. Moral concern shouldn't stop at national borders.

Fourth, support international cooperation. Many of the challenges we face—climate change, pandemics, nuclear weapons, economic instability—require global solutions. Nationalism that prevents such cooperation is self-defeating.

Fifth, welcome diversity. Nations are not and have never been homogeneous. The attempt to enforce national uniformity has caused immense suffering. Embracing diversity within nations makes them stronger, not weaker.

Sixth, distinguish patriotism from nationalism. Patriotism is love of your country. Nationalism is the belief that your country is superior and that its interests should always come first. You can be patriotic without being nationalistic.

Breaking free from nationalistic nonsense doesn't mean becoming rootless or cosmopolitan in a way that ignores local attachments. It means holding national identity in perspective—as one identity among many, as a construction rather than an essence, as something that should serve human flourishing rather than demand sacrifice to itself.

The world faces challenges that no nation can solve alone. Climate change, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, economic instability—these require cooperation across national boundaries. Nationalism that prevents such cooperation is not just morally problematic—it's practically dangerous.

We need new forms of identity and solidarity that transcend national boundaries while still honoring local attachments. This is difficult, but it's necessary.

In the next chapter, we'll explore how education shapes our beliefs—often in ways we don't recognize.

But for now, I want you to examine your own national identity.

Where did it come from? What does it include and exclude? Does it serve you and others well, or does it limit your thinking and your compassion?

The lines on maps are real. But so is our common humanity. And in the end, that common humanity matters more than the accidents of where we were born.
