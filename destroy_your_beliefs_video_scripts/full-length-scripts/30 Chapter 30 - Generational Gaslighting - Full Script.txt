Generational Gaslighting
Beyond Age-Based Stereotypes

Welcome back. Today we're examining generational stereotypes—Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z—and why they're mostly nonsense.

When researchers actually study generational differences, they find that most variation happens within generations, not between them. A 25-year-old from rural Texas has more in common with a 55-year-old from rural Texas than with a 25-year-old from Brooklyn.

Many "generational" differences are actually age differences. Young people have always been more idealistic. Older people have always been more cautious. That's not Millennials versus Boomers—that's youth versus age.

The generational categories are arbitrary. Why does a generation span 15-20 years? These boundaries are invented, not discovered.

Generational narratives distract from real issues. Blaming Millennials for "killing" industries ignores economic changes. Blaming Boomers for housing costs ignores policy decisions.

So why are generational stereotypes so popular? They're easy. They sell. They feel true because of confirmation bias.

The harm is real. Generational stereotypes fuel unnecessary conflict. They lead to discrimination. They prevent genuine understanding.

The alternative is simple: See people as individuals. Look at structural factors when you see differences between age groups. Find common ground.

Generational labels are lazy thinking dressed up as insight.

In the next chapter, we'll examine the pursuit of happiness.
