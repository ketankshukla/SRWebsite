The Progress Paradox
Questioning the March of Civilization

Welcome back. Today we're questioning the belief in progress—the assumption that things are always getting better.

Yes, there's been real progress. Life expectancy has doubled. Extreme poverty has plummeted. Violence has declined. Rights have expanded.

But the progress narrative hides important complexities.

Trade-offs exist. Economic growth brought material abundance—and environmental destruction. Technology brought convenience—and surveillance and addiction.

Distribution is uneven. Progress hasn't benefited everyone equally. Some have gained while others have been harmed.

Inevitability is assumed. If we believe progress is automatic, we become complacent about problems that require active intervention.

Material and human progress are confused. We have more stuff than ever. But are we happier? Wiser? More connected?

What we've lost gets ignored. Traditional knowledge, community bonds, connection to nature—these have often been casualties of "progress."

So what's a more honest view?

Recognize genuine improvements without romanticizing the past. Acknowledge costs and trade-offs. Question inevitability. Define progress carefully—in terms of human flourishing, not just GDP. Stay humble about the future.

Progress is real but complicated. The honest view holds both the gains and the losses.

In the next chapter, we'll examine our relationship with technology.
