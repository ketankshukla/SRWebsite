Moral Mirages
The Shifting Sands of Right and Wrong

Welcome back. Today we're exploring something that feels absolutely solid but might be more fluid than you think: morality.

We all have strong moral intuitions. Some things feel obviously right; others feel obviously wrong. These feelings are so powerful that they seem to be tracking objective truths about the universe—moral facts that exist independently of what anyone thinks.

But what if morality is more like a mirage—something that appears solid from a distance but dissolves when you look closely?

Let's examine this carefully.

First, consider the diversity of moral beliefs across cultures and time.

Practices that seem obviously wrong to us were considered morally acceptable—even virtuous—in other times and places. Slavery was practiced and defended by educated, religious people for millennia. Human sacrifice was a sacred duty in some ancient cultures. Child marriage was normal throughout most of history. The subjugation of women was considered natural and right.

Were all these people simply evil? Or were they moral people operating within different moral frameworks?

The diversity of moral beliefs suggests that what feels obviously right is often just what's normal in your culture. Moral intuitions are shaped by upbringing, not by access to objective moral truths.

Second, consider where moral intuitions come from.

Evolution has shaped our moral psychology. Traits like empathy, fairness, and loyalty helped our ancestors survive and reproduce in social groups. We feel these things strongly because feeling them was adaptive.

But evolution doesn't produce truth—it produces survival. Our moral intuitions might be useful fictions rather than accurate perceptions of moral reality.

Culture further shapes our moral intuitions. We absorb the values of our society before we can evaluate them. What feels like personal moral conviction is often internalized cultural programming.

Third, consider the difficulty of grounding morality objectively.

If moral truths exist objectively, where do they come from? Some say God—but we've seen the problems with that view. Some say reason—but people reason to very different moral conclusions. Some say human nature—but human nature includes both cooperation and cruelty.

Philosophers have debated moral foundations for millennia without reaching consensus. This doesn't prove that objective morality doesn't exist, but it suggests that if it does, it's very hard to access.

So is morality just arbitrary? Is everything permitted?

Not quite. Let me offer a more nuanced view.

Morality might be a human construction without being arbitrary. We construct morality to serve human purposes—to enable cooperation, reduce suffering, promote flourishing. These purposes aren't arbitrary; they're grounded in what humans actually need and want.

Think of morality like language. Language is a human construction—there's nothing in nature that makes "dog" the right word for a certain animal. But language isn't arbitrary; it serves real communicative purposes and has internal logic and structure.

Similarly, morality is constructed to serve real purposes. Different cultures construct it differently, just as they construct different languages. But there are constraints—moral systems that promote too much suffering or prevent cooperation tend to fail.

This view is called moral constructivism or moral relativism, depending on how it's formulated. It says that moral truths are real within human frameworks, even if they're not written into the fabric of the universe.

What are the implications of this view?

First, it encourages humility. If morality is constructed rather than discovered, we should be less certain that our moral views are correct. People in other cultures, with different moral frameworks, aren't necessarily wrong—they're operating within different constructions.

This doesn't mean we can't make moral judgments. We can still say that some practices cause unnecessary suffering and should be changed. But we should make these judgments with humility, recognizing that we too are products of our moral culture.

Second, it encourages focus on consequences. If morality isn't handed down from above, we need some basis for evaluating moral claims. One natural basis is consequences: Does this practice reduce suffering? Does it promote flourishing? Does it enable cooperation?

This consequentialist approach isn't the only option, but it provides a way to evaluate moral claims without appealing to divine authority or objective moral facts.

Third, it encourages moral progress. If morality is constructed, it can be reconstructed. We're not bound by the moral views of our ancestors. We can evaluate our inherited morality and improve it.

This is what moral progress looks like. We've expanded our circle of moral concern from tribe to nation to humanity to animals. We've recognized rights for groups that were previously excluded. We've reduced acceptance of cruelty and violence.

This progress isn't the discovery of pre-existing moral facts. It's the construction of better moral frameworks—frameworks that reduce suffering and promote flourishing more effectively.

Fourth, it encourages dialogue. If morality is constructed, then moral disagreements are disagreements about how to construct our shared moral framework. They're not battles between those who see the truth and those who are blind to it.

This reframing can make moral dialogue more productive. Instead of trying to prove that the other side is objectively wrong, we can explore our different values, understand our different perspectives, and seek common ground.

Now, some people find this view deeply unsettling. If morality isn't objective, they worry, then anything goes. Without moral facts, there's no basis for condemning atrocities.

But this worry is misplaced. We can condemn atrocities because they cause immense suffering, violate human dignity, and undermine the conditions for human flourishing. We don't need objective moral facts to make these judgments—we just need to care about suffering and flourishing.

And we do care. That caring is built into us by evolution and culture. It's not arbitrary—it's deeply human.

The absence of objective moral facts doesn't mean morality doesn't matter. It means morality is our responsibility. We can't outsource it to God or the universe. We have to construct it ourselves, as carefully and wisely as we can.

This is actually empowering. We're not passive recipients of moral truth—we're active creators of moral frameworks. We can take responsibility for our values, examine them critically, and improve them over time.

So how do we navigate morality without objective foundations?

First, take moral intuitions seriously but not uncritically. Your moral feelings are data, but they're not infallible. They've been shaped by evolution and culture in ways that might not serve you or others well.

Second, focus on reducing suffering and promoting flourishing. These aren't arbitrary goals—they're what almost everyone actually cares about. They provide a basis for moral reasoning that doesn't require metaphysical foundations.

Third, seek to understand other perspectives. People with different moral views aren't necessarily evil or stupid. They might be operating within different frameworks, prioritizing different values, or seeing different aspects of complex situations.

Fourth, be willing to update your moral views. If morality is constructed, it can be improved. Be open to arguments that challenge your current views. Moral growth is possible and valuable.

Fifth, take responsibility. You can't outsource morality to authority—religious, political, or otherwise. You have to think for yourself, make your own judgments, and take responsibility for your choices.

In the next chapter, we'll explore economic beliefs—examining the free market fantasy and how our economic assumptions shape society.

But for now, I want you to examine your own moral beliefs.

Where did they come from? Are they based on careful reasoning, or on absorbed cultural programming? Would someone from a different culture see things the same way?

And most importantly: Are your moral beliefs actually serving the purposes morality should serve—reducing suffering, promoting flourishing, enabling cooperation?

Morality might be a human construction. But that doesn't make it less important.

It makes it more important—because we're the ones responsible for getting it right.
