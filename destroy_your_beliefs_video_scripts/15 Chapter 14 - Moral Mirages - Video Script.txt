You know what's right and wrong. Or do you?

Your moral beliefs feel like absolute truths. But here's the uncomfortable reality: most of what you believe is right or wrong depends on when and where you were born.

Think about it. Slavery was once considered morally acceptable—even virtuous—by educated, religious people. Human sacrifice was a sacred duty in some ancient cultures. Child marriage was normal for most of human history.

Were all those people evil? Or did they just absorb the morality of their time and place—exactly like you've absorbed yours?

This raises a big question: Is morality objective and universal? Or is it something humans invented?

Let's look at where morality comes from.

Evolution plays a role. Traits like empathy, fairness, and cooperation helped our ancestors survive in groups. We're wired to care about others—at least others in our tribe.

But evolution doesn't create perfect moral systems. It creates "good enough" instincts that vary based on environment. That's why different cultures developed different moral codes.

Culture shapes morality even more. You learned right and wrong from your parents, your religion, your society. If you'd been born somewhere else, you'd have learned different rules—and they'd feel just as obviously true.

This is moral relativism: the idea that morality isn't universal truth, but varies by culture and context.

That sounds scary. If morality is relative, can we condemn anything? Is everything permitted?

Not quite. Here's a better way to think about it.

Morality is like a technology—a tool humans developed to live together. We created rules to reduce harm, enable cooperation, and help communities function.

Some moral "technologies" work better than others. We can evaluate them by their outcomes: Do they reduce suffering? Do they promote flourishing? Do they treat people fairly?

This means morality can evolve. We can improve our ethics as we learn more about human nature and the consequences of our actions.

Think about moral progress. We've expanded our circle of concern from tribe to nation to humanity to animals. That's not discovering pre-existing moral facts—it's moral innovation.

So what do you do with this?

First, hold your moral beliefs with humility. You might be wrong. People in the future might look at some of your beliefs the way you look at slavery.

Second, focus on outcomes. Instead of asking "Is this allowed by my moral code?" ask "Does this reduce suffering? Does this help people flourish?"

Third, stay open to moral growth. Your ethics at 40 should be more sophisticated than at 20. If your morality never changes, you're probably not thinking hard enough.

Morality isn't handed down from the cosmos. It's something we build together. And that means we can build it better.
