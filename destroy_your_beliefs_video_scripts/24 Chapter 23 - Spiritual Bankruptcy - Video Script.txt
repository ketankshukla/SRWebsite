Spirituality is having a moment. As traditional religion declines, a marketplace of spiritual offerings has emerged. Crystals. Manifestation. Energy healing. Mindfulness apps. Ayahuasca retreats.

But here's the question: Is this genuine spirituality, or spiritual fast food?

Let's look at what's happening.

First, commodification. Profound traditions developed over centuries are being stripped of context and sold as products. Mindfulness, rooted in Buddhist ethics and the dissolution of ego, becomes a productivity hack. Yoga, a comprehensive spiritual discipline, becomes exercise class.

The depth gets lost. What remains is technique without transformation.

Second, magical thinking. Much of modern spirituality promotes beliefs that aren't supported by evidence. That your thoughts directly create reality. That you can manifest your desires through visualization. That crystals have healing powers.

These beliefs might feel good. But they're not true. And they can distract from actions that actually work.

Third, spiritual bypassing. Using spiritual concepts to avoid dealing with real problems. Instead of processing trauma, you "transcend" it. Instead of addressing relationship issues, you focus on "raising your vibration." Instead of taking practical action, you wait for the universe to provide.

Spirituality becomes an escape from life rather than a deeper engagement with it.

Fourth, exploitation. The spiritual marketplace is full of gurus and teachers who exploit followers—emotionally, financially, sometimes sexually. The promise of enlightenment can be used to manipulate vulnerable people.

So is all spirituality bankrupt?

No. Humans have always sought meaning, transcendence, and connection to something larger. These are genuine needs. And throughout history, people have reported profound experiences that go beyond ordinary consciousness.

The question is how to pursue authentic spirituality.

Be skeptical of commercialized offerings. If someone's selling enlightenment, be cautious. Genuine spiritual growth usually isn't a product.

Maintain critical thinking. Spirituality and rationality aren't opposites. You can seek transcendence while staying grounded in reality.

Do the work. Real spiritual growth is often difficult and uncomfortable. It involves confronting yourself honestly, not just feeling good.

Look for depth, not just experience. Profound traditions offer more than techniques—they offer frameworks for understanding life and ethics. Engage with that depth.

Find community carefully. Spiritual community can be valuable, but watch for manipulation and groupthink.

Authentic transcendence is possible. But you won't find it in a product.

In the next video, we'll examine science itself—and its limitations.
