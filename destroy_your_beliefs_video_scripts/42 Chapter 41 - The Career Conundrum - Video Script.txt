What do you do?

It's usually the first question we ask when meeting someone. As if their job defines who they are.

We've built our identities around work. We sacrifice health, relationships, and personal interests for career advancement. We feel like failures if our professional lives don't follow the expected path.

But what if this whole framework is a trap?

The modern concept of "career"—a linear climb through increasingly senior positions—is actually pretty new. For most of human history, people worked to live. They didn't live to work.

The idea that your job should be your identity, your purpose, your primary source of meaning? That's a product of industrial capitalism, not human nature.

And it's causing problems.

People pursue careers for status or money, not genuine interest—then wonder why they're unfulfilled.

People feel like failures when their path isn't linear—even though non-linear paths are increasingly normal.

People sacrifice everything for work—health, relationships, experiences—and regret it later.

People tie their self-worth to professional achievement—and crash when careers hit obstacles.

Meanwhile, the nature of work is changing rapidly.

Lifelong employment at one company is rare now. Entire industries are being disrupted. The skills valued today may be obsolete in a decade. The traditional career ladder is breaking down.

So what's a healthier approach?

Separate identity from occupation. You are not your job. Your worth doesn't depend on your title or salary.

Find meaning in multiple places. Work can be meaningful, but so can relationships, creativity, community, learning. Don't put all your eggs in the career basket.

Embrace non-linear paths. Sideways moves, career changes, breaks, experiments—these aren't failures. They're how many fulfilling lives actually unfold.

Value flexibility. In a changing world, adaptability matters more than rigid plans. Be ready to pivot.

Define success for yourself. Not by society's metrics, not by others' expectations. What does a good life actually look like to you?

Work matters. But it's not everything. A life built entirely around career is a fragile life.
