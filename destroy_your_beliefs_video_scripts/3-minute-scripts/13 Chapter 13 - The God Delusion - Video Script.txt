Does God exist?

It's one of the oldest questions humans have ever asked. And whatever you believe, it's worth examining why.

Billions of people believe in some form of God or gods. But here's something interesting: the God you believe in usually depends on where you were born. If you grew up in Saudi Arabia, you're probably Muslim. In India, likely Hindu. In America, probably Christian.

If there's one true God, why does belief cluster by geography instead of spreading based on truth?

This suggests something important: religious beliefs might tell us more about human psychology than about cosmic reality.

Our brains evolved to see patterns and detect agents—to assume that things happen because someone made them happen. This helped our ancestors survive. Rustling in the bushes? Better assume it's a predator than ignore it.

But this same wiring makes us prone to seeing intention where there is none. We see faces in clouds, meaning in coincidences, and design in nature.

Religion also serves deep psychological needs. It offers comfort in the face of death, explanations for the unexplainable, community and belonging, and a sense of cosmic importance.

None of this proves God doesn't exist. But it does explain why humans would create and believe in gods even if they weren't real.

What about the arguments for God?

The cosmological argument says everything needs a cause, so the universe needs a cause—God. But then what caused God? If God doesn't need a cause, why does the universe?

The design argument says the universe looks designed, so there must be a designer. But evolution explains complexity without a designer. And if God designed everything, who designed God?

The moral argument says objective morality requires God. But humans have developed moral systems across cultures without agreeing on gods. And if morality comes from God's commands, is something good because God says so, or does God say so because it's good?

Meanwhile, science keeps finding natural explanations for things we once attributed to gods—lightning, disease, the origin of species, the formation of planets.

So what if there is no God?

Here's what it doesn't mean: it doesn't mean life has no meaning. It doesn't mean morality doesn't matter. It doesn't mean nothing is sacred.

It means we create meaning. We build ethics. We decide what's sacred.

That's not a loss—it's a responsibility. And maybe a liberation.

You don't need a cosmic plan to live a good life. You don't need divine reward to be kind. You don't need eternal life for this life to matter.

Whether or not God exists, you still have to decide how to live. And that choice is yours.

In the next video, we'll question something else we take for granted: our sense of right and wrong.
