How many of your beliefs did you actually choose?

Think about it. Your views on money, relationships, success, religion, politics—where did they come from? Chances are, most of them were handed down to you before you were old enough to question them.

These are inherited beliefs. And they might be running your life without you even knowing it.

Here's how it works. From the moment you're born, you absorb the beliefs of your family, your community, your culture. These ideas feel like facts because you've never known anything different. They're the water you swim in.

But just because a belief is old doesn't mean it's true. And just because your family believes something doesn't mean it's right for you.

Take Maria. She grew up in a traditional family where women were expected to prioritize marriage and motherhood over career. She was smart and ambitious, but she never questioned this belief—until she met successful women in leadership roles. Suddenly, she realized her "limits" weren't real. They were just ideas she'd inherited.

This happens to all of us in different ways.

Maybe you inherited the belief that money is evil, so you unconsciously sabotage your own success. Maybe you were taught that asking for help is weakness, so you struggle alone when you don't have to. Maybe you absorbed the idea that your worth depends on your productivity, so you can never rest.

These beliefs feel like part of who you are. But they're not. They're just programs running in the background—programs you didn't write.

One of the biggest inherited delusions is the myth of meritocracy: the idea that success comes purely from hard work and talent. It sounds fair, but it ignores the massive role that luck, timing, connections, and systemic advantages play.

This belief can make successful people think they deserve all the credit—and make struggling people think they deserve all the blame. Neither is true.

So how do you break free?

Start by becoming a detective of your own mind. When you notice a strong belief, ask yourself: Where did this come from? Did I choose this, or was it given to me? Does it actually match my experience?

Expose yourself to different perspectives. Read books by people who think differently. Have conversations with people from different backgrounds. Travel if you can. The more you see how differently others live, the more you realize your way isn't the only way.

This doesn't mean rejecting everything you were taught. Some inherited beliefs are valuable. The goal isn't to throw out your entire heritage—it's to examine it consciously and keep what serves you.

The hardest part? This process might create tension with people you love. When you start questioning shared beliefs, it can feel threatening to others. Be patient with them, and with yourself.

Breaking free from inherited delusions isn't about finding the "right" beliefs to replace them. It's about developing the ability to think for yourself—to choose your beliefs consciously instead of accepting them by default.

You didn't choose where you were born or who raised you. But you can choose what you believe now.
