How many times have you checked your phone today?

Social media promised to connect us. Instead, it's rewiring our brains, polarizing our societies, and making many of us miserable.

Here's what's really happening.

Social media companies make money from your attention. Every feature is designed to keep you scrolling. The infinite feed. The notifications. The likes. It's not an accident—it's engineering.

They use the same psychology as slot machines. Variable rewards keep you checking. Maybe there's something new. Maybe someone liked your post. Maybe you're missing something important. That uncertainty is addictive.

And the content you see? It's curated by algorithms optimized for engagement. What engages people? Outrage. Fear. Conflict. Content that confirms what you already believe.

The result is filter bubbles. You see a version of reality tailored to your existing views. People who disagree with you seem not just wrong, but crazy—because you never see their reasonable arguments, only their most extreme statements.

This is making us more polarized. Different groups are literally seeing different realities. And the platforms profit from the division.

There's also the comparison trap. You see everyone's highlight reel—their vacations, achievements, perfect moments. You compare it to your ordinary life and feel inadequate. But you're comparing your behind-the-scenes to their greatest hits.

Studies link heavy social media use to anxiety, depression, and loneliness—especially in young people. We're more connected than ever, but we feel more alone.

So what do you do?

First, recognize the manipulation. These platforms are designed to be addictive. Your struggle to put down your phone isn't weakness—it's the intended effect.

Second, set boundaries. Turn off notifications. Set time limits. Delete apps from your phone if needed. Make checking social media a conscious choice, not a reflex.

Third, curate intentionally. Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad. Seek out diverse perspectives. Remember that what you see isn't reality—it's what the algorithm thinks will keep you engaged.

Fourth, prioritize real connection. Social media is a poor substitute for actual relationships. Invest in face-to-face time with people who matter.

Fifth, protect your attention. Your attention is valuable—that's why companies fight for it. Spend it on things that actually improve your life.

Social media isn't going away. But you can use it consciously instead of being used by it.

In the next video, we'll examine the myths we believe about relationships.
