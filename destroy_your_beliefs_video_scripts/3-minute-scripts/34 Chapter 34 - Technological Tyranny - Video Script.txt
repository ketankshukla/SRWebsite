Technology is supposed to serve us. But increasingly, we serve it.

Think about your relationship with your phone. How many times do you check it daily? Can you go an hour without it? Do you reach for it automatically, without even deciding to?

We've become tethered to our devices in ways that would have seemed dystopian a generation ago. And it's not an accident—it's by design.

Tech companies employ thousands of engineers whose job is to capture and hold your attention. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every variable reward is engineered to keep you engaged. You're not the customer—you're the product.

The costs are real.

Attention fragmentation. The average person can't focus for more than a few minutes without checking something. Deep work, deep reading, deep thinking—these are becoming rare.

Social media distortion. Algorithms promote outrage and division because that's what gets engagement. Your view of the world is shaped by what keeps you scrolling, not what's true or important.

Mental health impacts. Rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness have spiked, especially among young people who grew up with smartphones. Correlation isn't causation, but the timing is hard to ignore.

Work invasion. Email and messaging mean you're always reachable. The boundary between work and life has dissolved. Technology promised leisure; it delivered constant availability.

Surveillance normalization. Your location, your purchases, your communications, your browsing—all tracked, stored, analyzed. We've accepted a level of monitoring that would have been unthinkable before.

So what do you do?

Set boundaries. Designate phone-free times and spaces. Turn off notifications. Don't sleep with your phone in the bedroom.

Be intentional. Use technology for specific purposes, not as a default activity. Ask: Am I choosing this, or is it choosing me?

Protect attention. Your attention is valuable—that's why companies fight for it. Guard it like the precious resource it is.

Question defaults. Just because a feature exists doesn't mean you should use it. Just because everyone's on a platform doesn't mean you need to be.

Demand better. As citizens and consumers, we can push for technology that serves human flourishing rather than exploiting human psychology.

Technology isn't going away. But you can reclaim your relationship with it.

In the next video, we'll examine the productivity trap.
