Your brain is amazing. It can solve complex problems, create art, and understand the universe.

But here's the twist: that same brain is also building invisible prisons around your thinking—without you even knowing it.

These mental traps are called cognitive biases. They're shortcuts your brain takes to make quick decisions. And while they helped our ancestors survive, today they often hold us back.

Let me show you what I mean.

Ever held onto something way too long—a bad investment, a failing relationship, a job you hate—just because you'd already put so much into it? That's the sunk cost fallacy. Your brain tricks you into thinking past effort justifies future suffering. It doesn't.

Or think about this: when someone cuts you off in traffic, you probably think they're a jerk. But when you cut someone off? You had a good reason—you were late, distracted, whatever. This is called the fundamental attribution error. We judge others by their actions but ourselves by our intentions.

There's also loss aversion. Losing something feels about twice as painful as gaining something feels good. So we play it safe, avoid risks, and miss opportunities—all because our brain overweights potential losses.

And here's a sneaky one: confirmation bias. Once you believe something, your brain actively looks for evidence that proves you right—and ignores everything that doesn't. This is why people with opposite views can look at the same facts and walk away more convinced than ever.

Perhaps the most dangerous trap is the Dunning-Kruger effect. The less you know about something, the more confident you tend to feel. Real experts know how much they don't know. Beginners often don't.

So what can you do about all this?

The first step is simply awareness. Once you know these traps exist, you can start catching yourself falling into them.

When you're about to make a decision, pause and ask: Am I holding onto this because it makes sense—or because I've already invested too much? Am I seeking out different viewpoints—or just looking for people who agree with me? Am I judging someone harshly for something I'd excuse in myself?

You won't catch every bias. Nobody does. But the more you practice this kind of thinking, the freer your mind becomes.

Critical thinking isn't about being negative or skeptical of everything. It's about seeing reality more clearly—and making better choices because of it.

Your brain will always have these shortcuts built in. The goal isn't to eliminate them. It's to recognize when they're running the show—and take back control.

In the next video, we'll explore why staying comfortable might be the most dangerous thing you can do.
