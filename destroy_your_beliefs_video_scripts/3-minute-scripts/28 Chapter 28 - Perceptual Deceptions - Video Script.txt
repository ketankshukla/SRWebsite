You trust your senses. You see the world as it is. Right?

Not exactly.

Your brain doesn't show you reality. It shows you a construction—a best guess based on incomplete information, prior expectations, and unconscious processing.

Here's what's actually happening.

Your eyes have a blind spot where the optic nerve connects. You should see a gap in your vision. But you don't—your brain fills it in. You're literally not seeing part of reality, and your brain is making it up.

When you watch a movie, you see smooth motion. But it's actually still images flashing rapidly. Your brain constructs the experience of movement from fragments.

Optical illusions aren't glitches—they're windows into how perception normally works. Lines that are the same length look different. Colors shift based on context. Your brain is always interpreting, not just receiving.

And it goes deeper than visual tricks.

You see what you expect to see. Show people an ambiguous image and they'll interpret it based on what they were primed to expect. We literally perceive differently based on our beliefs.

Emotions shape perception. When you're afraid, neutral faces look threatening. When you're happy, the world looks brighter. Your internal state changes what you see.

Attention is selective. You miss obvious things when you're focused elsewhere. The famous "invisible gorilla" experiment showed that people watching a video and counting basketball passes completely missed a person in a gorilla suit walking through the scene.

So what does this mean?

Your experience of reality is not reality itself. It's a model your brain builds—useful, but not complete or perfectly accurate.

This should make you humble. What seems obviously true based on your direct experience might be a construction. Other people might literally be seeing things differently.

It should make you curious. If perception is constructed, what else might you be missing? What might you be adding that isn't there?

It should make you open. When someone describes an experience differently than you would, they might not be wrong or lying. They might be perceiving differently.

Your senses are tools, not windows. They help you navigate the world, but they don't show you the world as it truly is.

In the next video, we'll examine the myth of natural talent.
