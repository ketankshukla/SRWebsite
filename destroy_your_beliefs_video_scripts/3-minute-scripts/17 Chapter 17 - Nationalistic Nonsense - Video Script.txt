You probably feel something when you see your country's flag. Pride, maybe. A sense of belonging.

But have you ever asked why?

Nationalism is one of the most powerful forces in human history. People kill for it. Die for it. Vote for it. But when you look closely, it starts to seem... arbitrary.

Think about it. National borders are mostly accidents of history—lines drawn by colonial powers, wars, treaties. The "national character" we attribute to different peoples? Mostly stereotypes. There's more variation within countries than between them.

National histories are carefully edited stories. Every nation emphasizes its glorious moments and downplays its atrocities. The narrative you learned in school was designed to make you feel a certain way about your country.

Nationalism is actually pretty new. Before the 18th century, most people identified with their religion, their village, or their lord—not their nation. National identities were deliberately constructed through education, symbols, and shared myths.

None of this means national identity is meaningless. Culture, language, shared history—these matter. Community matters. But nationalism becomes dangerous when it turns into tribalism.

When "my country" becomes "my country right or wrong."

When national pride means looking down on other nations.

When borders become more important than human beings.

The biggest problems we face today—climate change, pandemics, economic instability—don't respect national borders. They require global cooperation. But nationalism often blocks that cooperation.

And within nations, exclusive nationalism marginalizes anyone who doesn't fit the dominant story. Immigrants, minorities, anyone who's "different" becomes an outsider.

So what's the alternative?

It's not abandoning all sense of place or culture. You can love where you're from without thinking it's superior. You can appreciate your heritage without using it to exclude others.

Think of identity like concentric circles. You can be part of a family, a community, a region, a nation, AND humanity—all at once. The question is which circle you prioritize when they conflict.

When national interest conflicts with human welfare, which wins?

When your country does something wrong, can you admit it?

When someone from another country needs help, do they matter less because of where they were born?

Nationalism gave us a sense of belonging. But in a connected world, we need broader forms of solidarity.

The lines on maps are real. But so is our common humanity.
