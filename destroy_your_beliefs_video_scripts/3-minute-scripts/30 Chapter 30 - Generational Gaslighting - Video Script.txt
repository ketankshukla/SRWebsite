Millennials are entitled. Boomers are out of touch. Gen Z can't focus. Gen X is... forgotten.

You've heard these stereotypes. You might even believe them. But here's the thing: they're mostly nonsense.

Generational categories are one of the biggest examples of collective gaslighting in modern culture. Let me explain.

First, the science doesn't support it. When researchers actually study generational differences, they find that most variation in attitudes and behaviors happens within generations, not between them.

A 25-year-old from rural Texas has more in common with a 55-year-old from rural Texas than with a 25-year-old from Brooklyn. Class, geography, education, race—these factors matter far more than birth year.

Second, many "generational" differences are actually age differences. Young people have always been more idealistic and risk-tolerant. Older people have always been more cautious and traditional. That's not Millennials versus Boomers—that's youth versus age. It's been true for centuries.

Third, the categories are arbitrary. Why does a generation span 15-20 years? Why are the cutoffs where they are? These boundaries are invented, not discovered. They're marketing constructs, not scientific categories.

Fourth, generational narratives distract from real issues. Blaming Millennials for "killing" industries ignores economic changes. Blaming Boomers for housing costs ignores policy decisions. The generational frame turns structural problems into personality conflicts.

So why are generational stereotypes so popular?

They're easy. Complex social trends get reduced to simple stories about group characteristics.

They sell. Media loves generational conflict. Consultants sell generational training. Marketers target generational segments.

They feel true. Confirmation bias kicks in. You notice examples that fit the stereotype and ignore ones that don't.

What's the harm?

Generational stereotypes fuel unnecessary conflict. They lead to discrimination in hiring. They prevent genuine understanding between people of different ages.

So what's the alternative?

See people as individuals. Someone's birth year tells you almost nothing about who they are.

Look at structural factors. When you see differences between age groups, ask what economic, technological, or policy changes might explain them.

Find common ground. People across generations share more than the narratives suggest. Focus on that.

Question the categories. When you hear "Millennials are..." or "Boomers think...", be skeptical. It's probably an oversimplification.

Generational labels are lazy thinking dressed up as insight.
