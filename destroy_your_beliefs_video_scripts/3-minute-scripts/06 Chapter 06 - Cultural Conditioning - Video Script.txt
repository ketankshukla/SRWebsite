Imagine you're a fish. You've lived your whole life in water. Would you even know water exists?

That's what culture does to us. It's so all-around us that we don't even see it. But it shapes everything—how we think, what we value, what we believe is possible.

This is called cultural conditioning. And understanding it might be one of the most important things you ever do.

From the moment you're born, your culture starts programming you. Your family, your school, the media, your friends—they all teach you what's "normal." What success looks like. How men and women should act. What's polite and what's rude. What dreams are realistic and which ones are crazy.

The tricky part? None of this feels like programming. It just feels like "the way things are."

Here's an example. Alex grew up in a Western culture that valued individual achievement, direct communication, and personal independence. To Alex, this was just... normal.

Then Alex took a job in a different country with a more collectivist culture. Suddenly, everything was confusing. Coworkers prioritized group harmony over personal recognition. They communicated indirectly to avoid conflict. Family obligations came before career ambitions.

Alex realized something huge: what felt like universal truth was actually just one culture's way of doing things.

This happens to all of us. We think our values are obvious and correct—until we see that billions of people live completely differently.

Think about how culture shapes gender roles. In some places, women are expected to prioritize family over career. In others, that expectation doesn't exist. Neither is "natural"—both are cultural programming.

Or think about success. In some cultures, success means wealth and status. In others, it means community respect or spiritual growth. Your definition of success was probably handed to you before you could question it.

Culture even shapes how you see yourself. Are you an independent individual, or part of a larger group? Is your identity fixed, or can it change? Different cultures answer these questions completely differently.

So what do you do with this information?

First, recognize that your "normal" isn't universal. The things you take for granted—your values, your assumptions, your goals—are products of where and when you grew up.

Second, expose yourself to different cultures and perspectives. Travel if you can. Read books from other traditions. Have real conversations with people who grew up differently than you.

Third, start questioning. Ask yourself: Do I believe this because I chose it, or because my culture taught me to? Is this value actually serving me, or am I just following the script?

This doesn't mean rejecting your culture entirely. There's wisdom and beauty in cultural traditions. The goal is to engage with your culture consciously—keeping what serves you and questioning what doesn't.

When you see the invisible strings, you get to choose which ones to keep and which ones to cut.

In the next video, we'll look at why tradition—even when it's harmful—is so hard to let go of.
