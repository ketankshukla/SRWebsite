Have you ever been absolutely sure about something... only to find out later you were completely wrong?

We all do it. We grab onto beliefs—about life, about ourselves, about how the world works—and we hold on tight. These beliefs feel like solid ground. But here's the uncomfortable truth: that feeling of certainty? It's often just an illusion.

Think about it. Throughout history, the smartest people on Earth have been dead wrong about things they were completely sure of.

Doctors used to drain blood from sick patients, convinced it would heal them. It actually killed people. Scientists once believed the sun revolved around the Earth. Everyone "knew" it was true—until it wasn't.

This isn't ancient history either. Even today, we fall into the same trap. We surround ourselves with information that confirms what we already believe, and we ignore anything that challenges us. It's called confirmation bias, and we all have it.

So why are we wired this way?

Simple: our brains evolved to keep us alive, not to see the world accurately. Back when we were avoiding predators and finding food, quick, confident decisions kept us safe. Doubt could get you killed.

But that same wiring causes problems today. In our complex modern world, being too certain closes our minds. It stops us from learning. It creates conflict with people who see things differently.

This affects everything in our lives.

How many friendships have ended over arguments where both sides were "absolutely right"? How many people have stayed stuck in bad situations because they were certain they couldn't change? How many opportunities have we missed because we were sure we already had all the answers?

The less we actually know about something, the more confident we often feel. It's a strange quirk of the human mind—and it keeps us trapped.

Here's the good news: there's a way out.

It starts with one simple shift—recognizing that your beliefs aren't facts. They're just your current best guess about how things work. And guesses can be updated.

The ancient philosopher Socrates said the wisest thing he knew was that he knew nothing. That's not giving up on knowledge—it's staying open to it.

When you let go of the need to be right all the time, something amazing happens. You start actually learning. You become more adaptable. You connect better with people who think differently than you.

Certainty feels safe. But it's often a cage.

The real freedom comes from getting comfortable with not knowing everything—and staying curious anyway.

In the next video, we'll explore the mental prisons we build for ourselves, and how to start breaking free.
