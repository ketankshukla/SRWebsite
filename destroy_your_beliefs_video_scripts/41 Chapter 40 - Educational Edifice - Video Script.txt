We've talked about how education indoctrinates. Now let's ask: What could education become?

The current system was built for the industrial age. Rows of desks. Standardized content. Tests measuring memorization. Compliance rewarded, creativity discouraged.

But the world has completely changed. And education hasn't kept up.

What does today's world actually need?

Not memorization—information is everywhere. We need the ability to find, evaluate, and use information.

Not fixed skills—they become obsolete quickly. We need adaptability and the capacity to keep learning.

Not isolated individual work—most real challenges require collaboration. We need teamwork and communication skills.

Not passive absorption—the world needs problem-solvers. We need creativity and critical thinking.

So what could education look like?

Learning by doing. Instead of abstract lessons, students tackle real projects and problems. They learn because they need to know, not because it's on the test.

Personalized paths. Not everyone learns the same way or at the same pace. Technology and flexible structures can allow individualized learning.

Mixed ages and abilities. Why group by birth year? Learning communities can mix ages, with older students teaching younger ones and everyone learning from each other.

Connected to community. Learning happens in the real world, not just in classrooms. Students engage with local issues, businesses, and organizations.

Emphasis on questions, not just answers. The ability to ask good questions matters more than memorizing right answers.

Intrinsic motivation. When learning connects to genuine interests and purposes, external rewards become less necessary.

Lifelong learning. Education doesn't end at graduation. We need systems that support continuous learning throughout life.

This isn't utopian fantasy. Schools and programs around the world are experimenting with these approaches. They work.

The obstacle isn't lack of alternatives. It's the weight of tradition, the inertia of institutions, and beliefs about what education "should" look like.

Reimagining education means questioning those beliefs. It means asking what we actually want for learners—and building systems that deliver it.

In the next video, we'll examine our beliefs about work and career.
