Things are getting better. Technology advances. Knowledge grows. Society becomes more just. Right?

The belief in progress is so deep in modern thinking that questioning it feels almost heretical. But let's look closer.

Yes, there's been real progress. Life expectancy has doubled. Extreme poverty has plummeted. Violence has declined. Rights have expanded. Scientific knowledge has exploded.

But the progress narrative hides important complexities.

First, trade-offs. Progress in one area often means regress in another. Economic growth brought material abundance—and environmental destruction. Technology brought convenience—and surveillance, addiction, and alienation. Globalization lifted millions from poverty—and disrupted communities and traditions.

Second, uneven distribution. Progress hasn't benefited everyone equally. The prosperity of some nations was built on exploitation of others. Within societies, some groups have gained while others have been left behind or actively harmed.

Third, the assumption of inevitability. If we believe progress is automatic, we become complacent. We dismiss concerns about new developments as resistance to change. We fail to actively address problems.

Fourth, the confusion of material and human progress. We have more stuff than ever. But are we happier? Wiser? More connected? Rates of depression, anxiety, and loneliness have increased in wealthy societies. Material progress doesn't automatically translate to human flourishing.

Fifth, what we've lost. Traditional knowledge, community bonds, connection to nature, meaningful work, slower rhythms of life—these have often been casualties of "progress." We rarely count these losses.

So what's a more honest view?

Recognize genuine improvements. Don't romanticize the past. Many things really are better.

But also acknowledge costs. Progress isn't free. Every gain comes with trade-offs. We should be honest about what we've lost.

Question inevitability. Progress isn't automatic. It requires effort, and it can reverse. We shouldn't take it for granted.

Define progress carefully. More technology isn't automatically progress. More GDP isn't automatically progress. The question is: Are humans flourishing? Is the planet healthy?

Stay humble about the future. We don't know where we're heading. The confident predictions of past generations often look foolish now. Ours probably will too.

Progress is real but complicated. The honest view holds both the gains and the losses.
