Why are you here? What's the point of your life?

These might be the most important questions you'll ever ask. And the answer might surprise you.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: the universe doesn't care about you. It has no plan for your life. There's no cosmic purpose written in the stars.

The universe is vast, ancient, and completely indifferent to human concerns. We exist because of billions of years of random events—not because someone designed us for a reason.

That sounds depressing. But stay with me, because there's a twist.

If the universe doesn't give you meaning... you get to create it yourself.

Think about that. You're not searching for a purpose that's hidden somewhere. You're not failing if you haven't "found your calling." Instead, you're the author. You get to decide what matters.

The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called this being "condemned to be free." There's no script. No predetermined path. Just you, making choices, creating meaning through your actions.

This is actually liberating.

It means the meaning you find in your work, your relationships, your passions—that's real. It's not less valuable because you created it. A painting isn't less beautiful because the artist made it up.

Viktor Frankl survived Nazi concentration camps. He noticed that prisoners who found meaning—even in suffering—were more likely to survive. He concluded that humans can endure almost anything if they have a "why."

But here's the key: that "why" doesn't come from the universe. It comes from you.

So how do you create meaning?

Start with connection. Relationships—love, friendship, family—are one of the most powerful sources of meaning. We're social creatures. Isolation drains meaning; connection creates it.

Find work that matters to you. Not necessarily a dream job—but something where you can see the impact, where you're contributing, where you're growing.

Embrace challenges. Meaning often comes from struggle. The things we work hardest for become the most meaningful.

Contribute to something larger than yourself. A cause, a community, a legacy. When your life touches others, it gains significance.

Here's what's beautiful about this: you're not waiting for meaning to be revealed. You're not failing if life feels meaningless sometimes. You're just in the process of creating.

The universe is a blank canvas. Your life is the painting.

That's not a burden. That's a gift.

In the next video, we'll explore the biggest illusion of all: your sense of self.
