You're in control of your life. Your choices determine your outcomes. If you work hard and make good decisions, you'll succeed.

That's the story we tell ourselves. But how true is it?

The illusion of control is one of our most persistent beliefs—and one of the most misleading.

Here's what research shows: People consistently overestimate their ability to influence outcomes. We see patterns in randomness. We take credit for successes that were largely luck. We construct stories that make our lives seem more orderly than they are.

Think about success. We love stories of self-made people who achieved everything through talent and hard work. But look closer at any success story and you'll find luck everywhere.

Being born in the right country. Having educated parents. Meeting the right mentor. Being in the right industry at the right time. Having good health. Countless factors you didn't choose.

Two people with identical abilities and work ethics can have completely different outcomes based on circumstances beyond their control.

This doesn't mean effort doesn't matter. It does. But effort operates within a context you didn't create.

The illusion of control has real consequences.

It makes us judge others harshly. If you believe outcomes are determined by choices, then poor people must have made bad choices. Struggling people must not be trying hard enough. This ignores systemic factors and luck.

It makes us blame ourselves unfairly. When things go wrong despite our best efforts, we assume we must have done something wrong. Sometimes bad things just happen.

It makes us overconfident. We underestimate risks because we think we can control outcomes. We double down on failing strategies because we can't accept that success isn't entirely up to us.

So what's the alternative?

Embrace uncertainty. Accept that you control less than you think. This isn't fatalism—you still make choices and take action. But you hold outcomes more lightly.

Focus on process, not just results. You can control your effort, your learning, your response to setbacks. You can't control everything that happens.

Practice compassion. For yourself when things don't work out. For others whose circumstances differ from yours.

Adapt readily. When you're not attached to the illusion of control, you can change course more easily when circumstances change.

Paradoxically, accepting what you can't control often makes you more effective at what you can.
