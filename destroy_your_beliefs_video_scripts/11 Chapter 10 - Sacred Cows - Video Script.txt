Everyone has beliefs they've never questioned. Beliefs so deep, so fundamental, that challenging them feels almost... wrong.

These are your sacred cows. And they might be the biggest obstacles to your growth.

A sacred cow isn't just a religious belief—though it can be. It's any idea you treat as untouchable. It could be political, personal, or cultural. It's the belief you defend automatically, without really thinking about why.

Here are some common ones:

"Hard work always leads to success." Sounds true, right? But research shows that luck, timing, connections, and systemic advantages play huge roles. This belief can make successful people arrogant and struggling people blame themselves unfairly.

"Technology is always progress." We assume newer is better. But technology also brings surveillance, addiction, job displacement, and environmental damage. The belief that tech is inherently good stops us from asking important questions.

"I know who I am." We build identities around fixed traits—"I'm an introvert," "I'm bad at math," "I'm not creative." But these labels can become prisons. They stop us from growing into who we could become.

"My political side is right." Left or right, most people treat their political beliefs like religion. They seek out confirming information and dismiss anything that challenges their view.

Here's the thing about sacred cows: they feel like facts, not beliefs. That's what makes them so hard to question.

So how do you find yours?

Look for strong emotional reactions. When someone challenges an idea and you feel defensive, angry, or anxious—that's a clue. Your mind is protecting something it considers sacred.

Try perspective-taking. Imagine someone from a completely different culture looking at your belief. Would it seem obviously true to them? Or would it look like just another cultural assumption?

Seek out contradicting information. Deliberately read arguments against your most cherished beliefs. Not to change your mind necessarily—but to test whether your beliefs can survive scrutiny.

Here's what's important: the goal isn't to have no beliefs. You need beliefs to function. The goal is to hold them lightly—to see them as your current best understanding, not as absolute truth.

When you do this, something powerful happens. You become less defensive. More curious. More open to learning. You stop seeing disagreement as a threat and start seeing it as an opportunity.

Your sacred cows feel like they're protecting you. But often, they're just limiting you.

The beliefs that feel most untouchable are usually the ones most worth examining.
