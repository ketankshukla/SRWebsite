You think you see the world clearly. But what you see is mostly what media shows you.

And media doesn't show you reality. It shows you a version of reality—one that's been selected, framed, and packaged to get your attention.

Here's how it works.

First, agenda-setting. Media doesn't tell you what to think, but it tells you what to think about. Whatever gets covered seems important. Whatever gets ignored might as well not exist.

Crime coverage is a perfect example. Violent crime has been declining for decades, but media coverage makes it seem like it's everywhere. Result? People believe the world is more dangerous than it actually is.

Second, framing. The same facts can be presented completely differently. Immigration can be framed as a humanitarian issue, an economic issue, or a security threat. The frame shapes how you feel about it—often before you've consciously thought about it.

Third, the business model. Most media makes money from attention. What gets attention? Conflict. Outrage. Fear. Drama. Not nuance. Not context. Not "it's complicated."

This creates a distorted picture of reality. The world seems more dangerous, more divided, more extreme than it actually is. Because that's what gets clicks.

Fourth, social media algorithms. These are designed to maximize engagement—and outrage is engaging. The most extreme, divisive content spreads fastest. You end up in a bubble where everyone seems to agree with you, and the other side seems insane.

Misinformation spreads faster than corrections. Emotional reactions happen before fact-checking. And the platforms profit from all of it.

So what do you do?

Develop media literacy. Ask: Who created this? What's their incentive? What perspectives are missing? What emotional reaction is this trying to provoke?

Diversify your sources. Deliberately seek out perspectives that challenge your views. If you only consume media that confirms what you already believe, you're not getting informed—you're getting reinforced.

Slow down. The urge to react immediately is part of the manipulation. Take time to think before sharing, commenting, or forming an opinion.

Accept complexity. Real issues are complicated. If an explanation seems too simple, it probably is. Be suspicious of narratives with clear heroes and villains.

The goal isn't to distrust everything. It's to consume media consciously instead of passively. To recognize when you're being manipulated. To form opinions based on reality, not on what someone wants you to believe.
