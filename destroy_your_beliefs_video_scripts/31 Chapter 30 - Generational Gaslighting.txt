Generational Gaslighting

Beyond Age-Based Stereotypes

As we continue our journey of dismantling belief systems, we encounter a set of beliefs that have become increasingly prominent in recent decades: generational stereotypes. Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z—we're constantly told that these groups have distinct characteristics, values, and behaviors. But what if these generational categories are more fiction than fact? What if they're a form of gaslighting that obscures more than it reveals?

Generational thinking has exploded in popularity. Media outlets, marketers, and management consultants constantly invoke generational differences to explain everything from workplace dynamics to political trends to consumer behavior. Each generation is assigned a set of defining traits: Boomers are entitled, Millennials are narcissistic, Gen Z is anxious.

But when researchers actually study generational differences, they find far less than the popular narratives suggest. Most of the variation in attitudes and behaviors occurs within generations rather than between them. A Millennial from rural Alabama has more in common with a Boomer from rural Alabama than with a Millennial from San Francisco.

Moreover, many supposed generational differences are actually age effects—differences that reflect where people are in their life cycle rather than when they were born. Young people have always been more idealistic and risk-tolerant; older people have always been more conservative and security-focused. Attributing these patterns to generational identity confuses age with cohort.

The generational narrative also obscures the enormous diversity within each supposed generation. Class, race, gender, geography, and countless other factors shape people's experiences and perspectives far more than their birth year. Lumping together everyone born within a 15-20 year span as if they share a common identity is a gross oversimplification.

Generational stereotypes can be harmful. They fuel intergenerational conflict, with each generation blaming others for societal problems. They lead to discrimination in hiring and workplace treatment. They distract from the structural factors—economic changes, policy decisions, technological shifts—that actually shape people's opportunities and challenges.

Breaking free from generational gaslighting means recognizing these categories for what they are: marketing constructs and media narratives rather than meaningful social science. It means seeing people as individuals shaped by complex factors rather than as representatives of their birth cohort.

By moving beyond age-based stereotypes, we can engage more authentically with people across generational lines.
