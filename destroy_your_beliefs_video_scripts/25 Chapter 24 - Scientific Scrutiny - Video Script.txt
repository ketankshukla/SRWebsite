Science is our best tool for understanding reality. But even science deserves scrutiny.

This isn't about rejecting science—it's about understanding it clearly. Because when we treat science as infallible, we actually undermine it.

Here's what you should know.

First, the replication crisis. Many published scientific findings don't hold up when other researchers try to reproduce them. In some fields, more than half of studies fail to replicate. That's a problem.

Why does this happen? Publication bias—journals prefer exciting positive results over boring null findings. Pressure to publish—researchers need publications for their careers, creating incentives to find significant effects. Questionable practices—cherry-picking data, running multiple analyses until something looks significant.

The result? The scientific literature contains more errors than most people realize.

Second, science is done by humans. Scientists have biases, make mistakes, and are influenced by their cultural context. The history of science includes scientific racism, the pathologization of homosexuality, and countless other examples of social prejudice dressed up as objective truth.

Third, funding shapes research. Who pays for science influences what questions get asked. Corporate-funded research often favors corporate interests. Government priorities shape what gets studied. Important questions without funding don't get answered.

Fourth, science has limits. The scientific method is powerful for empirical questions about the natural world. But it can't directly answer questions about values, meaning, or ethics. When scientists make claims in these areas, they're speaking as individuals, not as scientists.

So what do you do with this?

Don't reject science. Despite its flaws, the scientific method—with its emphasis on evidence, testing, and revision—remains our best tool for understanding reality. Nothing else comes close.

But be appropriately skeptical. Single studies aren't definitive. Look for replicated findings and scientific consensus. Be especially cautious about preliminary results that make headlines.

Distinguish science from scientism. Science tells us about the natural world. It doesn't tell us how to live or what to value. Those are philosophical questions.

Understand the process. Science isn't a collection of facts—it's a method of inquiry. Findings are provisional, always subject to revision. That's a feature, not a bug.

Watch for misuse. Science can be distorted to serve agendas. Look at who funded the research, what questions weren't asked, and whether conclusions go beyond the evidence.

Science works because it's self-correcting. But that correction requires scrutiny—including scrutiny of science itself.
