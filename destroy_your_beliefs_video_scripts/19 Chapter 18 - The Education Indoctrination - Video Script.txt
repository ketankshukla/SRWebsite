Think back to school. Rows of desks. A teacher at the front. Bells telling you when to move. Tests measuring how well you memorized information.

Did you ever wonder why it was designed that way?

Modern education was built during the industrial revolution. Its purpose wasn't to create independent thinkers—it was to create factory workers. Punctual. Obedient. Able to follow instructions. Comfortable with repetitive tasks.

The economy has completely changed. But schools? Not so much.

We still group kids by age, as if everyone develops at the same rate. We still emphasize memorization over understanding. We still use standardized tests that reward conformity over creativity.

And the content? History is taught as a triumphant national story, with uncomfortable parts edited out. Science is presented as facts to memorize, not a method of questioning. Success is measured by grades, not by curiosity or growth.

There's also a hidden curriculum—lessons you absorb without realizing it.

Defer to authority. Compete with your peers. Your worth is measured by external validation. The right answer matters more than the right question. Sit still. Don't challenge the teacher.

These lessons shape how you see yourself and the world long after you leave school.

And despite all the talk about equal opportunity, education often reinforces inequality. Schools in wealthy areas have more resources. Standardized tests measure socioeconomic advantage as much as ability. The system sorts people into winners and losers early, and those labels stick.

So what would better education look like?

First, prioritize critical thinking over memorization. The ability to evaluate information, ask good questions, and change your mind is more valuable than any collection of facts.

Second, embrace different kinds of intelligence. Not everyone learns the same way. Not everyone excels at the same things. A system that only rewards one type of thinking wastes enormous human potential.

Third, teach learning itself. In a rapidly changing world, the ability to learn new things matters more than any specific knowledge. Yet we rarely teach people how to learn effectively.

Fourth, encourage questioning. The best education doesn't just give you answers—it helps you ask better questions. Including questions about education itself.

This doesn't mean teachers don't matter or that structure is bad. But we can create systems that empower learners instead of just sorting them.

The goal of education should be to help people think for themselves—not to produce compliant workers who accept whatever they're told.
