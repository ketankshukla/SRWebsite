Work hard and you'll succeed. The cream rises to the top. You get what you deserve.

This is the meritocracy myth. And while it's comforting, it's mostly false.

Let's look at reality.

Your birth circumstances—which you didn't choose—have enormous effects on your life outcomes. A child born to wealthy, educated parents in a stable country has completely different opportunities than one born into poverty or conflict.

Even within one society, the playing field isn't level. Quality of schools varies by neighborhood. Access to healthcare varies by income. Social networks—who you know—vary by family background.

Discrimination is real. Race, gender, class, disability—these factors shape opportunities in ways that have nothing to do with individual merit.

And luck plays a huge role. Being in the right place at the right time. Meeting the right person. Having a skill that happens to be valued in your era. Successful people often attribute to merit what was largely luck.

Research confirms this. Studies of identical twins separated at birth show how much environment matters. Studies of social mobility show how much your parents' position predicts yours. The "self-made" success story is usually a myth that ignores advantages and luck.

So why is the meritocracy belief so persistent?

It's comforting. It suggests the world is fair and you're in control.

It justifies inequality. If people get what they deserve, then the rich deserve their wealth and the poor deserve their poverty.

It motivates effort. If success depends on you, you'll work harder.

But the costs are real.

Successful people become arrogant. They overestimate their merit and underestimate their advantages.

Struggling people blame themselves. They internalize failure that's largely systemic.

Inequality gets justified. If the system is fair, why change it?

So what's a more honest view?

Acknowledge both agency and structure. Your choices matter—but so do circumstances you didn't choose.

Recognize your advantages. If you've succeeded, honestly assess how much was merit and how much was luck and privilege.

Have compassion for those struggling. Their situation often reflects circumstances, not character.

Support genuine equality of opportunity. If we actually believed in meritocracy, we'd work much harder to level the playing field.

The myth of meritocracy prevents us from creating actual meritocracy.
