# Chapter 15: Competition and DIY Objections

## When They Want to Do It Themselves or Work with Someone Else

Some prospects will want to handle the claim themselves or may be considering other companies. This chapter helps you navigate these situations professionally while demonstrating your value.

## Understanding DIY and Competition Objections

### Why People Want to DIY

1. **Save money**: Don't want to pay a fee
2. **Control**: Want to handle their own affairs
3. **Distrust**: Don't trust anyone else
4. **Capability**: Believe they can figure it out
5. **Pride**: Don't want to admit they need help

### Why They Consider Competitors

1. **Lower fees**: Found cheaper option
2. **First contact**: Someone else reached them first
3. **Referral**: Friend/family recommended someone
4. **Comparison shopping**: Want best deal
5. **Uncertainty**: Not sure who to trust

## DIY Objection Responses

### "I can do this myself"

**Why they say it:**

- Want to save the fee
- Confident in their abilities
- Don't see the value you add

**Response Strategy:**

1. Validate their right to DIY
2. Honestly explain what's involved
3. Highlight potential pitfalls
4. Let them make an informed choice

**Full Response:**

```
"You absolutely can file the claim yourself—it's your
right, and some people do.

Let me walk you through what's involved so you can
decide if it's something you want to take on:

1. Contact [county office] to get the claim form
2. Gather required documentation:
   - Proof of identity
   - Proof you were the owner at foreclosure
   - Copy of the deed
   - Documentation of the sale
3. Complete the claim form correctly
4. Submit with all required attachments
5. Follow up regularly (processing takes 60-120 days)
6. Respond to any requests for additional information
7. Possibly attend a hearing

If anything is missing or incorrect, your claim could
be rejected or delayed significantly.

I've done this [X] times and know exactly what each
county requires. But if you'd prefer to handle it
yourself, I respect that.

Would you like me to at least point you in the right
direction to get started?"
```

---

### "I'll just call the county myself"

**Why they say it:**

- Seems simple enough
- Want to verify information
- Don't want to pay fee

**Response Strategy:**

1. Encourage them to call (builds trust)
2. Explain what calling accomplishes vs. claiming
3. Differentiate verification from the full process
4. Offer to help after they verify

**Full Response:**

```
"I'd actually encourage you to call the county—it's a
great way to verify that the surplus funds exist.

When you call [county office] at [number], ask them:
- Is there surplus from the sale of [address]?
- What is the amount?
- What's required to claim it?

They'll confirm the funds exist. What they won't do is:
- Walk you through the entire process
- Prepare your documents
- Follow up on your behalf
- Handle any issues that arise

Verifying is step one. The actual claims process is
where most people get stuck.

After you verify, if you'd like help with the claim
itself, give me a call. I'm happy to help."
```

### "I don't need help with paperwork"

**Why they say it:**

- Confident in their abilities
- Underestimate complexity
- Don't want to pay for something they can do

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge their capability
2. Explain it's more than just paperwork
3. Highlight the expertise required
4. Offer value beyond paperwork

**Full Response:**

```
"I'm sure you're capable of handling paperwork. But
this is more than just filling out forms.

The challenge is knowing:
- Which forms are required (varies by county)
- What documentation to include
- How to properly prove ownership
- What language to use in the claim
- How to respond if there are issues
- When and how to follow up

I've seen claims rejected for small errors—wrong form,
missing document, incorrect information. Then the
person has to start over.

My value isn't just filling out paperwork. It's knowing
exactly what's needed to get your claim approved the
first time.

But if you'd prefer to try it yourself first, I
understand. Keep my number in case you run into issues."
```

---

### "I found information online about how to do this"

**Why they say it:**

- Did research
- Found DIY resources
- Confident they can follow instructions

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge their research
2. Caution about generic vs. specific information
3. Highlight local variations
4. Offer expertise in their specific situation

**Full Response:**

```
"That's great that you've done research. There is
information available online.

Here's what I'd caution: much of that information is
generic. The actual process varies significantly by:
- State
- County
- Type of foreclosure
- Specific circumstances

What works in one county may not work in another.
I specialize in [your area] and know exactly what
[specific county] requires.

If you'd like to try using the online resources, go
for it. But if you run into any issues or have
questions, feel free to reach out.

What county is your property in? I can tell you if
there's anything specific you should know."
```

## Competition Objection Responses

### "I'm already working with someone else"

**Why they say it:**

- Already signed with competitor
- In discussions with another company
- Loyal to first contact

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect their existing relationship
2. Ensure they're protected
3. Offer to be a backup
4. Don't badmouth competition

**Full Response:**

```
"I understand, and I respect that you've already made
a commitment.

Can I ask a few questions just to make sure you're
in good hands?

- Did they explain their fee clearly?
- Do you have a written contract?
- Have they given you a timeline?
- Do you know how to reach them if you have questions?

If everything checks out, great—I hope they recover
your funds quickly.

If for any reason things don't work out, please keep
my information. I'm here if you need me."
```

**If they haven't signed yet:**

```
"Are you already under contract, or still in discussions?

[If still in discussions]

Before you commit, I'd encourage you to compare:
- Fees and what's included
- Experience and track record
- Communication and responsiveness
- Reviews and references

I'm confident in what I offer, but you should choose
whoever you're most comfortable with. Would you like
to hear what I can do for you before you decide?"
```

---

### "Another company offered a lower fee"

**Why they say it:**

- Price shopping
- Found better deal
- Testing if you'll match

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge the lower offer
2. Caution about quality differences
3. Highlight your value
4. Let them make informed choice

**Full Response:**

```
"I appreciate you telling me that. There are companies
that charge less, and there are companies that charge
more.

Here's what I'd suggest considering beyond just the fee:

1. Experience: How many claims have they handled?
2. Success rate: What percentage are successful?
3. Service: How will they communicate with you?
4. Reputation: What do reviews say?
5. What's included: Are there any additional fees?

My fee of [X]% reflects my [experience/success rate/
service level]. I've recovered $[amount] for [X]
clients in [area].

A lower fee doesn't help if the claim is rejected or
takes twice as long. But ultimately, you should choose
whoever you trust most.

What's most important to you beyond the fee?"
```

---

### "Someone else contacted me first"

**Why they say it:**

- Loyalty to first contact
- Already have information
- Don't want to repeat conversations

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge they were contacted
2. Differentiate yourself
3. Encourage comparison
4. Offer unique value

**Full Response:**

```
"That's not surprising—surplus funds are public record,
so multiple companies may find the same information.

Being first doesn't necessarily mean being best. I'd
encourage you to compare before deciding:

- What fee did they quote?
- What's their experience?
- How did they make you feel?
- Did they answer all your questions?

I'm [your differentiator: local, more experienced,
better service, etc.]. I'd love the opportunity to
show you what I can offer.

Would you be open to a quick comparison before you
commit to anyone?"
```

---

### "I want to shop around first"

**Why they say it:**

- Smart consumer behavior
- Not ready to commit
- Want best deal

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect their approach
2. Provide comparison criteria
3. Highlight your strengths
4. Stay in consideration

**Full Response:**

```
"That's a smart approach. You should feel confident
in whoever you choose.

Here's what I'd suggest comparing:

Fee structure:
- What percentage do they charge?
- Are there any upfront or hidden fees?
- What's included?

Experience:
- How long have they been in business?
- How many claims have they handled?
- What's their success rate?

Service:
- How will they communicate with you?
- Can you reach them with questions?
- What do reviews say?

I'm happy to answer any questions that help you compare.
And when you're ready to decide, I hope you'll consider
working with me.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about
my service?"
```

### "My attorney said they can handle it"

**Why they say it:**

- Trust their attorney
- Already have professional relationship
- May be required in their state

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect the attorney relationship
2. Understand the situation
3. Offer collaboration if appropriate
4. Provide information

**Full Response:**

```
"If you have an attorney you trust, that's a great
resource. A few things to consider:

1. Does your attorney specialize in surplus funds
   recovery, or is this outside their usual practice?

2. What fee will they charge? Attorneys often charge
   hourly or a higher contingency percentage.

3. Is this something they'll prioritize, or will it
   be a lower priority among their other cases?

I specialize exclusively in surplus funds recovery,
so this is all I do. I know the process inside and out.

If your attorney would like to collaborate—perhaps
I handle the legwork and they review—I'm open to that.

Would it be helpful if I spoke with your attorney
directly?"
```

## Winning Back Lost Prospects

### When DIY Fails

**Follow-up script:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. We spoke a few months
ago about the surplus funds from your property.

You mentioned you were going to try claiming them
yourself. I wanted to check in—how did that go?

[If they had issues]

I'm sorry to hear that. The good news is, I can still
help. Would you like me to take over from here?"
```

### When Competitor Fails

**Follow-up script:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. We spoke a while back
about your surplus funds, and you mentioned you were
working with another company.

I wanted to check in—have you received your funds yet?

[If not]

I'm sorry that hasn't worked out. If you'd like, I can
review your situation and see if I can help move things
forward. Would that be helpful?"
```

## Differentiating Yourself

### Key Differentiators to Highlight

| Differentiator   | How to Communicate                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local expertise  | "I specialize in [county] and know exactly what they require"     |
| Experience       | "I've successfully recovered $[X] for [Y] clients"                |
| Success rate     | "My success rate is [X]%"                                         |
| Communication    | "I provide regular updates and am always available for questions" |
| Speed            | "I typically complete claims faster because I know the process"   |
| Personal service | "You work directly with me, not a call center"                    |

### Your Unique Value Proposition

Develop and practice your UVP:

```
"What makes me different is [specific differentiator].
For example, [concrete example or story]. That's why
my clients choose to work with me."
