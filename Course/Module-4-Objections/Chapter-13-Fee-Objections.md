# Chapter 13: Fee and Money Objections

## Communicating Value and Justifying Your Fee

Fee objections are inevitable. Your job is to help prospects understand the value you provide and why your fee is fair. This chapter covers every fee-related objection and how to handle it.

## Understanding Fee Objections

### Why People Object to Fees

1. **Sticker shock**: The percentage sounds high
2. **Don't understand the work**: Think it's easy
3. **Comparison shopping**: Heard of lower fees
4. **DIY mindset**: Believe they can do it themselves
5. **General frugality**: Object to any fee
6. **Negotiation tactic**: Testing if you'll lower

### The Value Equation

```
Perceived Value = (Benefits Received) / (Cost Paid)

If Perceived Value > 1, they'll pay
If Perceived Value < 1, they'll object
```

**Your job**: Increase perceived benefits, not just defend cost.

## Deep-Dive Fee Objection Responses

### "Your fee is too high"

**Why they say it:**

- Percentage sounds large
- Don't understand the work involved
- Comparing to other services

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge the concern
2. Break down what the fee covers
3. Compare to alternatives
4. Frame in terms of net benefit

**Full Response:**

```
"I understand the fee seems significant. Let me break down
what it covers and why it's structured this way.

My fee includes:
- Researching and verifying your claim
- Gathering all required documentation
- Preparing and filing the claim properly
- Following up with the county (often multiple times)
- Handling any issues or additional requests
- Ensuring you receive your funds

This process typically takes 20-40 hours of work over
several months.

More importantly, consider the alternative: You could
try to do this yourself, but if the claim is filed
incorrectly or missing documentation, it could be
rejected or significantly delayed.

With my fee, you're guaranteed to receive [100% - fee]%
of the funds with no effort on your part. Without help,
you might receive nothing or spend months trying.

Would you rather have $[net amount] guaranteed, or risk
getting nothing?"
```

### "Why should I pay you 30% when I can do it myself?"

**Why they say it:**

- Don't understand complexity
- Confident in their abilities
- Want to keep 100%

**Response Strategy:**

1. Validate their right to DIY
2. Explain what's actually involved
3. Highlight risks of DIY
4. Let them make an informed choice

**Full Response:**

```
"You absolutely have the right to file the claim yourself.
Let me explain what's involved so you can make an informed
decision.

To claim surplus funds in [county/state], you'll need to:

1. Obtain the correct claim form from [office]
2. Gather proof of identity and ownership
3. Obtain a copy of the deed showing you as owner
4. Get documentation of the sale and surplus amount
5. Complete the claim form correctly
6. Submit to the right office with all attachments
7. Follow up regularly (processing takes 60-120 days)
8. Respond to any requests for additional information
9. Potentially appear at a hearing

If any step is done incorrectly, your claim could be
rejected or delayed significantly.

I've done this [X] times and know exactly what each
county requires. My fee covers all of that expertise
and effort.

Some people prefer to handle it themselves, and that's
fine. Others prefer to have an expert handle it while
they focus on other things. Which sounds better for
your situation?"
```

---

### "Can you lower your fee?"

**Why they say it:**

- Negotiation instinct
- Budget concerns
- Testing your flexibility

**Response Strategy:**

1. Stand firm on value
2. Explain why fee is set
3. Offer alternatives if appropriate
4. Redirect to value, not price

**Full Response:**

```
"I appreciate you asking. My fee is set at [X]% because
it reflects the work involved and the expertise I bring
to ensure your claim is successful.

I've found that this rate allows me to provide the level
of service my clients deserve while running a sustainable
business.

What I can tell you is that my fee only applies if I'm
successful. You're not risking anything—if I don't
recover your funds, you pay nothing.

Rather than focusing on the fee percentage, let's look
at the outcome: You'll receive approximately $[net amount]
with no effort and no risk on your part.

Does that help put it in perspective?"
```

**Alternative if you have flexibility:**

```
"My standard fee is [X]%, but given [specific circumstance],
I could consider [Y]% for your case. Would that work for you?"
```

---

### "Other companies charge less"

**Why they say it:**

- Have received other offers
- Researched competitors
- Using as negotiation leverage

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge competition
2. Caution about quality differences
3. Highlight your value
4. Let them compare fairly

**Full Response:**

```
"You may find companies that charge less. I'd encourage
you to research them carefully before deciding.

Here are some questions to ask any company:

1. How long have they been in business?
2. What's their success rate?
3. Can they provide references?
4. What exactly is included in their fee?
5. How will they communicate with you?

My fee of [X]% reflects my [experience/success rate/service
level]. I've recovered $[amount] for [X] clients, and I
provide [specific value: personal attention, local expertise,
etc.].

Ultimately, you should choose whoever you're most comfortable
with. What's most important to you beyond just the fee?"
```

### "I don't have money to pay you"

**Why they say it:**

- Misunderstand payment structure
- Financial stress
- Concern about out-of-pocket costs

**Response Strategy:**

1. Clarify no upfront payment
2. Explain contingency structure
3. Show the math
4. Emphasize zero risk

**Full Response:**

```
"I want to make sure you understand—you don't pay anything
upfront. Not a penny.

Here's how it works: I do all the work to recover your
funds. When the claim is approved and you receive your
check, THEN you pay my fee from those funds.

Let me show you the math:
- Surplus funds: $[amount]
- My fee ([X]%): $[fee]
- You receive: $[net]

You're not spending money you have now. You're sharing
a portion of money you didn't know existed.

If I'm not successful, you pay nothing. You have zero
financial risk.

Does that make sense?"
```

---

### "What if you don't recover anything?"

**Why they say it:**

- Risk aversion
- Want to understand downside
- May have been burned before

**Response Strategy:**

1. Clearly state no-recovery policy
2. Explain why you're confident
3. Describe your process
4. Reassure about risk

**Full Response:**

```
"If I don't successfully recover your funds, you pay
absolutely nothing. That's the benefit of working on
contingency.

I take on all the risk. I invest my time and resources
upfront, and I only get paid if I deliver results.

I'm confident in taking this risk because:
1. I've verified the surplus funds exist
2. I've researched your eligibility
3. I know the process and requirements
4. I have a [X]% success rate

I wouldn't take your case if I didn't believe I could
successfully recover your funds.

Does that address your concern?"
```

---

### "How do I know you won't take more than agreed?"

**Why they say it:**

- Trust concerns
- Want to understand protections
- Fear of hidden fees

**Response Strategy:**

1. Explain contract protections
2. Describe payment process
3. Emphasize transparency
4. Offer to review contract together

**Full Response:**

```
"Great question. Here's how you're protected:

First, our agreement is a written contract that clearly
states my fee is [X]% of recovered funds. Nothing more.

Second, the funds come directly to you from the county—
I never handle your money. You receive the full amount,
then pay my fee.

Third, there are no hidden fees. The [X]% covers everything.
No administrative fees, no filing fees, no surprises.

I'm happy to go through the contract with you line by
line so you understand exactly what you're agreeing to.

Would that be helpful?"
```

---

### "I need to talk to my spouse/partner first"

**Why they say it:**

- Legitimate need for joint decision
- May be a stall tactic
- Financial decisions are shared

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect the need
2. Offer to include spouse
3. Provide information for discussion
4. Set follow-up

**Full Response:**

```
"Of course—this is an important decision, and you should
discuss it together.

Would it be helpful if I spoke with both of you? I'm
happy to answer any questions your [spouse/partner]
might have.

Alternatively, I can send information for you both to
review. That way you can discuss it and reach out when
you're ready.

What works best for you?"
```

**Follow-up:**

```
"When do you think you'll have a chance to discuss this?
I'd like to follow up and answer any questions that
come up."
```

---

### "I want to think about it"

**Why they say it:**

- Need processing time
- Not fully convinced
- May be a polite rejection

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect their need
2. Uncover the real concern
3. Provide additional information
4. Set specific follow-up

**Full Response:**

```
"Absolutely—take the time you need. This is an important
decision.

Can I ask what specifically you want to think about?
If there's a particular concern, I might be able to
address it now and help you make a more informed decision."

[Listen to their response]

"That makes sense. How about I send you some additional
information to review, and I'll follow up on [specific
day]? That gives you time to think it over.

Does [day/time] work for a follow-up call?"
```

## Reframing the Fee Conversation

### From Cost to Investment

**Instead of:** "My fee is 30%"
**Say:** "Your investment is 30% of funds you didn't know existed"

### From Percentage to Dollars

**Instead of:** "30% fee"
**Say:** "You'll receive $[net amount] with no effort"

### From Fee to Value

**Instead of:** "Here's what I charge"
**Say:** "Here's what you get: [list benefits]"

### From Risk to Security

**Instead of:** "You might not get the money otherwise"
**Say:** "You're guaranteed to receive your funds with my help"

---

## Fee Objection Prevention

### Set Expectations Early

Mention your fee structure in your opening:

```
"My fee is [X]% of recovered funds, paid only if I'm
successful. You pay nothing upfront and nothing if I
don't recover your money."
```

### Lead with Value

Before discussing fee, establish value:

```
"I handle everything—research, paperwork, filing,
follow-up—so you don't have to. Most clients spend
less than an hour of their time."
```

### Use Social Proof

Reference others who found the fee worthwhile:

```
"I've helped [X] people recover their surplus funds.
They found the fee worthwhile because [reason]."
```
