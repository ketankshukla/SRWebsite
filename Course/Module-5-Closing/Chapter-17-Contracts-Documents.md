```
"I'm going to send you our service agreement. It's
straightforward, but let me walk you through the
key points:

1. It identifies the property and surplus funds
2. It explains exactly what I'll do for you
3. It states my fee is [X]% of recovered funds
4. It confirms you pay nothing unless I'm successful
5. It gives me authorization to act on your behalf

Take your time reviewing it. If you have any questions,
I'm happy to explain anything. Once you sign and
return it, I'll get started on your claim."
```

### Addressing Contract Concerns

**"Why do I need to sign anything?"**

```
"The contract protects both of us. It clearly states
what I'll do, what my fee is, and that you pay nothing
unless I recover your funds. It also authorizes me to
act on your behalf with the county. Without it, I
can't file the claim for you."
```

**"Can I have my lawyer review it?"**

```
"Absolutely. I encourage you to have anyone you trust
review it. Take whatever time you need. Let me know
if there are any questions."
