# Chapter 16: Closing Techniques for Surplus Recovery

## Converting Prospects into Clients

Closing is simply helping someone make a decision that benefits them. In surplus funds recovery, you're helping people claim money they're entitled to. This chapter covers ethical, effective closing techniques.

---

## The Mindset of Closing

### What Closing Really Is

**Closing is NOT:**

- Manipulating someone into a decision
- Pressuring until they give in
- Tricking them into signing
- Winning at their expense

**Closing IS:**

- Helping them make a decision
- Summarizing the value
- Asking for commitment
- Making it easy to say yes

### The Helper Mindset

Remember: You're offering to recover money they didn't know they had. If they don't work with you (or someone), they may never see that money.

Closing is doing them a favor.

## When to Close

### Buying Signals

Watch for these signs they're ready:

**Verbal signals:**

- Asking about next steps
- Questions about timeline
- Discussing how they'll use the money
- Asking about paperwork
- Saying things like "So if I do this..."

**Behavioral signals:**

- Leaning in
- Nodding
- Taking notes
- Asking for your contact info
- Relaxed body language

### The Right Moment

Close when:

- You've addressed their main concerns
- They understand the value
- They've asked questions and gotten answers
- The conversation has natural momentum
- They show buying signals

Don't close when:

- They still have major objections
- They seem confused
- They're clearly not interested
- They're emotional/upset
- They haven't had time to process

## Closing Techniques

### 1. The Assumptive Close

**How it works:** Assume they're moving forward and discuss next steps.

**Example:**

```
"Great, so the next step is I'll email you the
authorization form. What email address should I
send it to?"
```

**When to use:** When they've shown clear interest and buying signals.

---

### 2. The Summary Close

**How it works:** Summarize the key points and ask for commitment.

**Example:**

```
"Let me make sure we're on the same page:

- There's approximately $[amount] in surplus funds
- I'll handle all the paperwork and filing
- You'll receive about $[net amount] after my fee
- The process takes about [timeframe]
- You pay nothing unless I'm successful

Does that all sound good? Ready to get started?"
```

**When to use:** After a longer conversation with multiple topics covered.

---

### 3. The Alternative Close

**How it works:** Give them a choice between two positive options.

**Example:**

```
"Would you prefer I email the paperwork or send it
by mail?"

"Would morning or afternoon work better for our
follow-up call?"

"Would you like to sign electronically or in person?"
```

**When to use:** When they're ready but need a gentle push.

---

### 4. The Direct Close

**How it works:** Simply ask for the commitment.

**Example:**

```
"Based on everything we've discussed, would you like
to move forward?"

"Are you ready to get started on recovering your funds?"

"Can I count on you as a client?"
```

**When to use:** When you've built rapport and addressed concerns.

---

### 5. The Urgency Close

**How it works:** Highlight legitimate time-sensitive factors.

**Example:**

```
"The deadline for claiming these funds is [date].
To make sure we have plenty of time, I'd recommend
we get started today. Can we do that?"
```

**When to use:** Only when there's genuine urgency (deadline, escheatment risk).

**Warning:** Never create false urgency.

---

### 6. The Trial Close

**How it works:** Test their readiness with a soft question.

**Example:**

```
"How does everything sound so far?"

"Do you have any other questions before we proceed?"

"Is there anything else you'd need to know to
make a decision?"
```

**When to use:** To gauge readiness before the final close.

---

### 7. The Takeaway Close

**How it works:** Suggest that maybe this isn't right for them.

**Example:**

```
"You know, this might not be the right fit for you.
If you're not comfortable or don't see the value,
I don't want to pressure you. What do you think?"
```

**When to use:** When they're on the fence and need to feel in control.

---

### 8. The Future Pacing Close

**How it works:** Help them visualize the positive outcome.

**Example:**

```
"Imagine a few months from now, you receive a check
for $[net amount]. What would that mean for you?
What would you do with it?

Let's make that happen. Ready to get started?"
```

**When to use:** When they need emotional motivation.

---

## The Closing Conversation Flow

### Step 1: Confirm Understanding

```
"Before we move forward, let me make sure I've
answered all your questions. Is there anything
else you'd like to know?"
```

### Step 2: Summarize Value

```
"So to recap: You have $[amount] in surplus funds.
I'll handle everything, and you'll receive
approximately $[net] with no effort on your part."
```

### Step 3: Address Final Concerns

```
"Is there anything holding you back from moving
forward today?"
```

### Step 4: Ask for Commitment

```
"Great. Let's get started. I'll send you the
authorization form right now. What's your email?"
```

### Step 5: Confirm Next Steps

```
"Perfect. You'll receive the form in the next few
minutes. Please review it, sign, and send it back.
Once I have that, I'll begin working on your claim
immediately. Any questions?"
```

## Handling "Almost" Closes

### When They Say "Almost"

**"I'm almost ready, but..."**

```
"I hear you. What's the 'but'? Let's address it
so you can feel completely confident."
```

**"I just need to..."**

```
"Of course. What do you need to do? And when can
we reconnect to finalize?"
```

**"Let me sleep on it"**

```
"I understand. What specifically do you want to
think about? Sometimes I can provide information
that helps with the decision."
```

### Creating Commitment

Even if they're not ready to sign, get some commitment:

- "Can I send you the paperwork to review?"
- "Can we schedule a follow-up call for tomorrow?"
- "Can I answer any final questions by email?"

---

## After the Close

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Send paperwork immediately**: Don't delay
2. **Confirm receipt**: Make sure they got it
3. **Set expectations**: When to return, what happens next
4. **Express appreciation**: Thank them for their trust
5. **Reassure**: Remind them they made a good decision

### The Confirmation Script

```
"Thank you for trusting me with this. I've just
sent the authorization form to your email.

Please review it—it's straightforward—and sign
where indicated. Once I receive it back, I'll
begin working on your claim right away.

You should receive your first update within [X days].
If you have any questions in the meantime, my
number is [number].

Thanks again, and I look forward to recovering
your funds!"
```

## Common Closing Mistakes

**Solution:** Always ask for the commitment

### Mistake 2: Asking Too Early

**Problem:** Closing before addressing concerns

### Mistake 3: Talking Past the Close

**Problem:** Continuing to sell after they've agreed
**Solution:** Once they say yes, move to next steps

### Mistake 4: Accepting Vague Responses

**Problem:** "I'll think about it" with no follow-up
**Solution:** Pin down specific concerns and next steps

### Mistake 5: Being Pushy

**Problem:** Pressuring when they're not ready
**Solution:** Respect their process, stay available
