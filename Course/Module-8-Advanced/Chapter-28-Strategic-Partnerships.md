## Building Referral Partnerships

### Identifying Potential Partners

**Best referral sources:**

| Partner Type          | Why They're Valuable              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Real estate attorneys | Handle foreclosures, know clients |
| Bankruptcy attorneys  | Clients may have surplus claims   |
| Real estate agents    | Know about foreclosures           |

### The Partnership Pitch

**For Attorneys:**

```
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] with [Company]. I specialize
in helping former homeowners recover surplus funds from
foreclosure sales.

I'm reaching out because I imagine you occasionally have
clients who've been through foreclosure. Many of them
don't realize they may have money waiting for them.

I'd love to be a resource for your clients. When you
encounter someone who might have surplus funds, I can
help them recover that money at no cost to them or you.

I also offer a referral fee for any clients you send my
way. Would you be open to a brief meeting to discuss
how we might work together?"
```

**For Real Estate Professionals:**

```
"Hi [Name], I help former homeowners recover surplus
funds from foreclosure sales—money most people don't
know exists.

I'm looking to partner with real estate professionals
who might encounter people affected by foreclosure.
When you come across someone who lost a property,
there's a good chance they have money waiting.

I handle everything and offer a referral fee for
introductions. Could we grab coffee to discuss?"
```
