## The Training Philosophy

### Principles of Effective Training

1. **Document everything**: If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Video demonstrations are powerful
3. **Start simple**: Build complexity gradually
4. **Verify understanding**: Test before trusting
5. **Provide feedback**: Continuous improvement requires input
6. **Update regularly**: Processes change, training should too

### The Training Investment

**Time spent training = Time saved later**

| Training Investment | Result             |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 hour training     | 10+ hours saved    |
| Good documentation  | Fewer questions    |
| Video tutorials     | Reusable forever   |
| Clear standards     | Consistent quality |

## Sample SOPs for Surplus Funds Tasks

### SOP: Researching Foreclosure Surplus Funds

```
# Researching Foreclosure Surplus Funds

## Purpose
To identify properties with surplus funds and gather
initial information for our lead list.

## When to Perform
Daily, or as assigned by manager.

## Tools Needed
- County website access (bookmarked)
- Lead tracking spreadsheet
- Calculator

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access County Records
1. Go to [County Website URL]
2. Navigate to "Foreclosure Sales" or "Surplus Funds"
3. Select date range (last 30 days)

### Step 2: Review Each Sale
For each foreclosure sale:
1. Note the property address
2. Note the sale date
3. Note the sale price
4. Note the original mortgage amount (if available)

### Step 3: Calculate Potential Surplus
1. Sale Price - Mortgage Amount = Potential Surplus
2. If surplus > $3,000, add to lead list
3. If surplus < $3,000, skip (not worth pursuing)

### Step 4: Enter into Spreadsheet
Enter the following for each qualified lead:
- Property address
- Sale date
- Sale price
- Estimated surplus
- Owner name (if available)
- Status: "New"

### Step 5: Save and Report
1. Save spreadsheet
2. Send daily summary to manager:
   - Number of sales reviewed
   - Number of qualified leads found
   - Total estimated surplus value

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All sales in date range reviewed
- [ ] Calculations double-checked
- [ ] All required fields completed
- [ ] Spreadsheet saved
- [ ] Summary sent

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't include properties with surplus under $3,000
- Don't forget to save your work regularly
- Don't estimate—use actual numbers from records

## What to Do If...
- Can't access website: Try again in 30 minutes,
  then notify manager
- Can't find mortgage amount: Enter "Unknown" and
  flag for follow-up
- Unsure if property qualifies: Add to list and
  flag for review

## Questions?
Slack [Manager Name] or email [email]

### SOP: Cold Calling Script Execution

```
# Cold Calling for Surplus Funds

## Purpose
To contact property owners, qualify interest, and
either close or transfer to closer.

## When to Perform
During scheduled calling hours.

## Tools Needed
- Phone/dialer system
- CRM with lead list
- Script (below)
- Objection responses document
- Transfer procedure

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare for Calls
1. Log into dialer/phone system
2. Open CRM to today's call list
3. Review script and objection responses
4. Test headset/microphone
5. Have water nearby

### Step 2: Make the Call
1. Click to dial from CRM
2. Let it ring 5-6 times
3. If voicemail, leave message (see script)
4. If answer, proceed with script

### Step 3: Opening Script
"Hi, is this [First Name]?"
[Wait for confirmation]

"[First Name], my name is [Your Name] calling from
[Company]. I'm reaching out because there may be
money owed to you from your former property at
[Address]. Do you have a quick minute?"

### Step 4: Qualify Interest
If interested, continue:
"When your property was sold, it sold for more than
what was owed. That extra money—called surplus funds—
belongs to you. We help people recover these funds."

Ask: "Were you aware there might be money from that sale?"

### Step 5: Handle Response

IF INTERESTED:
"Great! Let me tell you how this works..."
[Continue with explanation OR transfer to closer]

IF SKEPTICAL:
"I understand. You can verify this by calling [county]
at [number]. Would you like that information?"

IF NOT INTERESTED:
"I understand. Before I go, I just want you to know
there's approximately $[amount] that belongs to you.
Can I send you information to review?"

IF HOSTILE:
"I apologize for the interruption. Have a good day."
[End call politely]

### Step 6: Document the Call
In CRM, record:
- Call outcome (Answered/VM/No Answer/Wrong Number)
- Interest level (Hot/Warm/Cold/Not Interested)
- Notes on conversation
- Next action needed
- Schedule follow-up if applicable

### Step 7: Voicemail Script
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].
I'm calling about surplus funds from your former
property at [Address]. There may be money owed to you.
Please call me back at [Number]. Again, that's
[Your Name] at [Number]. Thank you."

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All assigned leads called
- [ ] Every call documented
- [ ] Follow-ups scheduled
- [ ] Hot leads transferred/flagged
- [ ] Call log completed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't argue with hostile people
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't forget to document every call
- Don't rush through the script

## What to Do If...
- They ask questions you can't answer: "Great question.
  Let me have my supervisor call you back with that
  information."
- They want to sign up immediately: Transfer to closer
  or schedule callback
- They're emotional: Be patient, empathetic, don't rush
```
