# Chapter 19: What to Outsource vs. Keep In-House

## Building a Leveraged Business

The key to scaling your surplus funds recovery business is knowing what tasks to delegate and what to keep for yourself. This chapter helps you make those decisions strategically.

## The Outsourcing Mindset

### Why Outsource?

1. **Leverage your time**: Focus on high-value activities
2. **Scale beyond yourself**: More leads, more clients, more revenue
3. **Reduce burnout**: Don't do everything yourself
4. **Access expertise**: Hire specialists for specific tasks
5. **Lower costs**: VAs often cost less than your hourly value

### The $100/Hour Test

Ask yourself: "Would I pay someone $100/hour to do this task?"

- **If NO**: Outsource it (it's below your value)
- **If YES**: Consider keeping it (it's high-value work)

### Your Highest-Value Activities

As the business owner, your time is best spent on:

1. Closing deals (talking to qualified prospects)
2. Building relationships
3. Strategic planning
4. Quality control
5. Business development

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Calculate Your Hourly Value

```
Your target annual income: $150,000
Working hours per year: 2,000
Your hourly value: $75/hour
```

### Compare to Outsourcing Cost

| Task                  | Your Time | VA Cost | Savings |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Research (10 hrs/wk)  | $750      | $150    | $600/wk |
| Data entry (5 hrs/wk) | $375      | $50     | $325/wk |
| Follow-ups (5 hrs/wk) | $375      | $75     | $300/wk |

**If VA cost < Your hourly value × hours saved = OUTSOURCE**
