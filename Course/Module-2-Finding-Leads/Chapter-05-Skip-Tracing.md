# Chapter 5: Skip Tracing and Locating Homeowners

## The Art of Finding People

Skip tracing is the process of locating people who have "skipped" or moved from their last known address. Since foreclosed homeowners have lost their homes, they've almost certainly moved. Finding them is critical to your success.

---

## Why Skip Tracing Matters

### The Challenge

- Former homeowners no longer live at the foreclosed property
- They may have moved multiple times
- They may be avoiding creditors
- Contact information in public records is outdated

### The Opportunity

- If you can't find them, neither can competitors
- Good skip tracing = competitive advantage
- Multiple contact methods increase success rates

---

## Skip Tracing Methods

### 1. Public Records Search

**Free resources:**

- **Voter registration**: Often has current addresses
- **Court records**: May show new addresses
- **Social media**: Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram
- **Google search**: Name + city + state
- **Whitepages.com**: Basic free searches
- **TruePeopleSearch.com**: Free people search
- **FastPeopleSearch.com**: Free contact info

**What to search for:**

- Full name + previous city
- Full name + state
- Property address
- Phone numbers you find
- Email addresses you find

### 3. Social Media Investigation

**Facebook:**

- Search name + location
- Check friends of known associates
- Look for tagged photos
- Check-ins may reveal location

**LinkedIn:**

- Professional information
- Current employer
- Location
- Connections

**Instagram:**

- Location tags
- Stories with location
- Tagged photos

**Tips:**

- Create a professional account for research
- Don't friend/follow (just observe)
- Screenshot relevant information
- Note connections for secondary contact

### 4. Relative and Associate Contact

**Finding relatives:**

- Same last name at previous address
- Listed on property records
- Found through social media
- Public records (marriage, birth, death)

**Using relatives:**

- Call and explain you have good news for [Name]
- Ask if they can pass along your contact info
- Be professional and brief
- Don't reveal details about the money

**Script:**

> "Hi, I'm trying to reach [Name] regarding a financial matter that could benefit them. I'm not a bill collector—this is actually good news. Could you help me get a message to them?"

## The Skip Tracing Process

### Step 1: Gather Initial Information

**From foreclosure records:**

- Full legal name
- Property address
- Any co-owners
- Mortgage company

**From property records:**

- Mailing address (if different)
- Previous owners
- Property history

### Step 2: Run Initial Searches

**Free searches first:**

1. Google the full name + city
2. Check social media platforms
3. Search free people-finder sites
4. Check voter registration

**Document everything:**

- Possible phone numbers
- Possible addresses
- Possible emails
- Relatives/associates found

### Step 3: Use Paid Services

**If free searches don't work:**

1. Run through batch skip tracing service
2. Review results for accuracy
3. Cross-reference multiple sources
4. Prioritize most recent data

### Step 4: Verify Information

**Before outreach:**

- Confirm name matches
- Check if address is valid
- Verify phone is active
- Look for red flags (deceased, incarcerated)

## Skip Tracing Best Practices

### Do's

✅ **Use multiple sources**: Cross-reference for accuracy
✅ **Start with free methods**: Save money on easy finds
✅ **Document everything**: Track what you've tried
✅ **Verify before contact**: Avoid wrong numbers/addresses
✅ **Update regularly**: People move; refresh data periodically
✅ **Be persistent**: Try multiple contact methods

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't harass**: Respect privacy and boundaries
❌ **Don't misrepresent**: Never claim to be someone you're not
❌ **Don't contact workplace**: Unless absolutely necessary
❌ **Don't share information**: Keep findings confidential
❌ **Don't give up too easily**: Good leads are worth effort

## Handling Difficult-to-Find People

### When Standard Methods Fail

**Try these advanced techniques:**

1. **Property records trail**

   - Did they buy another property?
   - Check surrounding counties
   - Search state property records

2. **Court records**

   - New lawsuits filed?
   - Divorce records?
   - Bankruptcy filings?

3. **Professional licenses**

   - State licensing boards
   - Professional associations
   - Business registrations

4. **Vehicle records**

   - DMV records (where accessible)
   - Vehicle registration

5. **Utility connections**
   - Some skip trace services include this
   - Shows where they set up new service

### When to Move On

**Consider moving to next lead if:**

- 5+ contact attempts with no response
- All contact info is invalid
- Person appears to be deceased
- Person is incarcerated long-term
- Cost of finding exceeds potential fee

## Building a Skip Tracing System

### For Solo Operators

**Workflow:**

1. Export new leads to spreadsheet
2. Run free searches (15 min per lead)
3. Batch remaining through paid service
4. Review and verify results

**Time budget:** 30-60 minutes per 10 leads

### For Outsourced Operations

**VA tasks:**

- Run free searches
- Input data into skip trace service
- Organize and verify results
- Flag problem leads

**Your tasks:**

- Review flagged leads
- Make final decisions
- Quality control

## Legal Considerations

### Permissible Purpose

Skip tracing services require you to have a legitimate business purpose. Surplus funds recovery qualifies, but:

- Don't use data for other purposes
- Don't share data with third parties
- Follow service terms of use
- Maintain records of your purpose

### Privacy Laws

- **FCRA**: Governs consumer reports
- **State laws**: Vary by jurisdiction
- **TCPA**: Governs phone contact
- **CAN-SPAM**: Governs email contact

### Best Practices

- Only search for legitimate business purposes
- Secure all data you collect
- Delete data you no longer need
- Don't sell or share personal information
