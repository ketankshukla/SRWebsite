## Step-by-Step Research Process

### Step 1: Identify Target Counties

**Criteria for good counties:**

- High foreclosure volume
- Accessible records (online preferred)
- Reasonable claims process
- No excessive regulations

**Start with:**

- Your local county (easiest to learn)
- 2-3 nearby counties
- Expand as you systematize

### Step 2: Find Recent Foreclosure Sales

**For each county, find:**

1. Where foreclosure auctions are held
2. When they occur (usually monthly)
3. Where results are published
4. How to access sale records

**Create a tracking spreadsheet:**

| Date | Property Address | Sale Price | Mortgage Amount | Potential Surplus | Owner Name |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
|      |                  |            |                 |                   |            |

### Step 3: Calculate Potential Surplus

**Basic calculation:**

```
Sale Price
- Mortgage balance (from foreclosure filing)
- Back taxes (from tax records)
- HOA liens (if applicable)
- Legal fees (estimate 5-10% of mortgage)
= Potential Surplus
```

**Important:** This is an estimate. Actual surplus may differ.

### Step 4: Verify Surplus Exists

**Contact the appropriate office:**

- County clerk
- Trustee who conducted sale
- Court (for judicial foreclosures)

**Ask:**

- "Is there surplus from the [date] sale of [property address]?"
- "What is the amount of surplus funds?"
- "Has anyone filed a claim yet?"

### Step 5: Identify the Rightful Claimant

**Research to find:**

- Owner of record at time of foreclosure
- Any junior lienholders
- Whether owner is deceased (check obituaries, probate records)
- Current contact information

## Building Your Lead Pipeline

### The Numbers Game

**Typical conversion funnel:**

```
100 Surplus Funds Found
↓
70 Have Valid Contact Info
↓
40 Actually Reached
↓
15 Interested in Learning More
↓
5 Sign Contracts
↓
3-4 Successful Claims
```

**Implication:** You need volume. Aim to research 20-50 new surplus funds per week minimum.

### Organizing Your Research

**Use a CRM or spreadsheet with:**

- Property address
- Sale date
- Surplus amount
- Owner name
- Contact info (phone, address, email)
- Outreach status
- Notes

**Recommended CRMs:**

- Podio (customizable, free tier)
- HubSpot (free tier available)
- Pipedrive (sales-focused)
- Monday.com (visual workflow)
- Simple spreadsheet (Google Sheets/Excel)

## Advanced Research Techniques

### 1. Batch Processing

Instead of researching one property at a time:

- Download all foreclosure sales for a month
- Batch calculate potential surplus
- Batch skip trace all owners
- Prioritize by surplus amount

### 2. Automated Alerts

Set up alerts for:

- New foreclosure filings
- Auction results
- Surplus funds postings

**Tools:**

- Google Alerts
- County notification systems
- Paid monitoring services

### 3. Historical Research

Don't just look at recent sales:

- Many counties have years of unclaimed surplus
- Older claims may have less competition
- Check statute of limitations in your state

### 4. Networking for Leads

Build relationships with:

- Real estate attorneys
- Title companies
- Foreclosure auction buyers
- Other surplus recovery specialists (for referrals)

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Skip These Leads

❌ **Surplus already claimed**: Check before outreach
❌ **Owner deceased with no clear heirs**: Complex probate issues
❌ **Active bankruptcy**: Funds may go to trustee
❌ **Multiple junior lienholders**: Complicated priority disputes
❌ **Very small surplus (<$1,000)**: Not worth the effort
❌ **Statute of limitations expired**: Funds may have escheated

### Proceed with Caution

⚠️ **Owner in prison**: Harder to reach, may need special procedures
⚠️ **Owner out of state/country**: Communication challenges
⚠️ **Corporate owner**: May have dissolved or changed
⚠️ **Multiple owners**: Need all signatures

## Creating a Research System

### Daily Research Routine

**Option A: Morning Research Block (2 hours)**

1. Check for new auction results (15 min)
2. Research 10 new properties (60 min)
3. Skip trace new leads (30 min)
4. Update CRM (15 min)

**Option B: Batch Weekly Research (1 day)**

1. Monday: Download all new data
2. Process and calculate surplus
3. Batch skip trace
4. Queue for outreach rest of week

### Outsourcing Research

Research is highly outsourceable:

- Virtual assistants can pull records

**What to keep in-house:**

- Final verification of surplus
- Quality control
