## The Opening Script

### Version 1: Direct Approach

```
"Hi, is this [First Name]?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"[First Name], my name is [Your Name] with [Company Name].
I'm calling with some good news about your former property
at [Property Address].

When the property was sold, it sold for more than what was
owed, and there are surplus funds that belong to you.

I help people recover these funds. Do you have a minute
to hear about this?"
```

### Version 2: Soft Approach

```
"Hi, is this [First Name]?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"[First Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm reaching out because
I came across some financial information related to a property
you previously owned at [Property Address].

I know that was probably a difficult time, and I apologize
for bringing it up. But I have some potentially good news.

Would you be open to hearing about it?"
```

### Version 3: Curiosity Approach

```
"Hi, is this [First Name]?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"[First Name], my name is [Your Name]. I specialize in
recovering unclaimed funds for former property owners.

I found your name connected to surplus funds from a
property sale. Were you aware that there might be money
owed to you?"
```

## The Core Message

### Key Points to Cover

After the opening, cover these points:

1. **What happened**: "When your property at [address] was sold at [auction type], it sold for more than what was owed."

2. **What exists**: "There's approximately $[amount] in surplus funds being held by [county/entity]."

3. **Who it belongs to**: "As the former owner, you're entitled to claim these funds."

4. **The challenge**: "The claims process can be complicated, with specific forms, deadlines, and requirements."

5. **Your service**: "I help people navigate this process and recover their funds."

6. **Your fee**: "My fee is [X]% of what I recover, and you pay nothing unless I'm successful."

7. **Next step**: "Would you like me to explain how the process works?"

## Handling Initial Responses

### Response: "How did you get my number?"

```
"That's a fair question. Your information is part of public
records related to the property sale. I research these records
to find people who may have unclaimed funds.

I understand this call is unexpected, but I wanted to make
sure you knew about this money. Would you like to hear more?"
```

### Response: "Is this a scam?"

```
"I completely understand why you'd ask that—there are
unfortunately scammers out there. Let me give you some
ways to verify this:

1. You can call [County Office] at [number] and ask about
   surplus funds from [property address]
2. You can look up my company at [website]
3. I'm happy to send you documentation first

Would any of those help you feel more comfortable?"
```

### Response: "I'm not interested"

```
"I understand, and I respect that. Before I let you go,
I just want to make sure you know: there's approximately
$[amount] that belongs to you.

You can claim it yourself by contacting [county office],
or I can send you information to review on your own time.
Would either of those be helpful?"
```

### Response: "How much money?"

```
"Based on my research, it appears to be approximately
$[amount]. I want to be clear that this is an estimate
based on public records—the exact amount would be
confirmed during the claims process.

Would you like me to explain how the recovery process works?"
```

### Response: "What's the catch?"

```
"Great question. Here's exactly how it works: I handle
all the paperwork and the claims process. If I successfully
recover your funds, my fee is [X]% of the amount recovered.
If I'm not successful, you pay nothing.

The only 'catch' is that I do charge a fee for my service.
But many people find it worthwhile because the process can
be complicated and time-consuming to do on your own.

Does that make sense?"
```

## Moving to the Close

### Trial Close Questions

Use these to gauge interest:

- "Does this sound like something you'd want to pursue?"
- "Would recovering this money be helpful to you?"
- "Do you have any questions about how this works?"
- "Would you like me to get started on your claim?"

### The Soft Close

```
"Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like this could
really help you. The next step would be for me to send you
some paperwork to review and sign.

I'll need some basic information from you, and then I can
get started on the claims process. Does that work for you?"
```

### The Direct Close

```
"[First Name], I've helped many people in similar situations
recover their surplus funds. I'd like to help you too.

If you're ready to move forward, I can email you the
paperwork right now and walk you through it.

What email address should I send it to?"
```

### The Alternative Close

```
"Would you prefer to receive the paperwork by email
or regular mail?"
```

## Voicemail Scripts

### Voicemail Version 1: Brief

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company Name].
I'm calling about surplus funds from your former property
at [Address]. There may be money owed to you.

Please call me back at [Phone Number]. Again, that's
[Your Name] at [Phone Number]. Thank you."
```

### Voicemail Version 2: Detailed

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company Name].

I'm reaching out because I found surplus funds connected
to a property you previously owned at [Address]. When the
property was sold, it sold for more than what was owed,
and that excess belongs to you.

I help people recover these funds at no upfront cost.
Please call me back at [Phone Number] to learn more.

Again, this is [Your Name] at [Phone Number].
I look forward to speaking with you."
```

### Voicemail Best Practices

## Follow-Up Call Scripts

### Second Call (No Previous Contact)

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company Name].
I left you a message recently about surplus funds from
your former property at [Address].

I wanted to try you again because this is time-sensitive
information. There's money that belongs to you, and I'd
hate for you to miss out on it.

Do you have a few minutes to discuss this?"
```

### Third Call (Still No Contact)

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] calling one more time
about the surplus funds from [Address].

I understand you're busy, but I want to make sure you're
aware that approximately $[amount] may be owed to you.

This will be my last call, but I'm happy to send you
information by mail if that's easier. My number is
[Phone Number] if you'd like to reach me."
```

### Follow-Up After Initial Conversation

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] following up on our
conversation about the surplus funds from your property.

I wanted to check in and see if you had any questions,
or if you're ready to move forward with the paperwork.

Is now a good time to talk?"
```
