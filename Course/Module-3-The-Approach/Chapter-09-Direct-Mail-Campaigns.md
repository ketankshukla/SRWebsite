## Direct Mail Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overwhelm with information
2. **Clear call to action**: Tell them exactly what to do
3. **Include verification**: How they can confirm this is real
4. **Professional appearance**: Quality paper, no typos
5. **Personalization**: Use their name and property address

### What to Include

✅ Their name and property address
✅ Approximate surplus amount
✅ Your contact information (multiple methods)
✅ How to verify the information
✅ Clear explanation of your service
✅ Your fee structure
✅ Call to action

### What to Avoid

❌ Threatening language
❌ False urgency or deadlines
❌ Guarantees you can't keep
❌ Government-like appearance (illegal in some states)
❌ Excessive legal jargon
❌ Typos or errors

| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Response rate     | 2-5%    | Responses ÷ Pieces sent     |
| Cost per response | $20-50  | Total cost ÷ Responses      |
| Conversion rate   | 20-40%  | Signed ÷ Responses          |
| Cost per client   | $50-150 | Total cost ÷ Signed clients |
