    <h2>🧠 The Psychology of Objections</h2>
    <p>
      Objections are not rejections—they're requests for more information. When
      someone objects, they're actually engaged and considering your offer.

        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The person who says "no" immediately is
        harder to convert than someone who raises objections.

    <h2>🔄 The LAER Framework</h2>
    <p>Use this 4-step process for every objection:</p>

          <th>Action</th>
          <th>Example</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>L</strong>isten</td>
          <td>Hear them out completely</td>
          <td>Don't interrupt, take notes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Address the real concern</td>

    <h2>🎯 Top 10 Common Objections</h2>

    <h3>1. "This sounds like a scam"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I completely understand why you'd be cautious—there 
are unfortunately scammers out there. Here's how you 
can verify this is real:

1. Call [County] at [Number]
2. Ask about surplus funds for [Your Address]
3. They'll confirm the money exists

I'm happy to wait while you verify, or I can call 
you back after you've checked."</code></pre>

    <h3>2. "I can do this myself"</h3>
    <pre><code>"You absolutely can, and I encourage you to try if 
you'd prefer. Here's what's involved:

- Gathering 5-10 documents
- Filing the proper forms with [County]
- Following up for 2-4 months
- Handling any complications

Many people start themselves and then call me when 
they get stuck. Would you like the county's number 
to get started?"</code></pre>

    <h3>3. "Your fee is too high"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I understand the fee seems significant. Let me put 
it in perspective:

Without my help, you'd receive $0—most people never 
claim these funds. With my help, you receive 
$[Amount after fee].

Plus, you pay nothing upfront and nothing if I'm 
unsuccessful. The fee only comes from money you 
wouldn't have otherwise."</code></pre>

    <h3>4. "I need to think about it"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Of course, this is an important decision. What 
specifically would you like to think about?

[Listen to their response]

I want to make sure you have all the information 
you need. Is there anything I can clarify right now?"</code></pre>

    <h3>5. "How do I know you're legitimate?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Great question—you should verify. Here's how:

1. Look up my company at [Website]
2. Check our reviews on Google
3. Call [County] to verify the funds exist
4. I'll send you a copy of my business license

Would any of those help you feel more comfortable?"</code></pre>
