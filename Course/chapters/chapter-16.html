    <h2>🧠 The Mindset of Closing</h2>
    <p>
      Closing isn't about manipulation—it's about helping someone make a
      decision that benefits them. If you've done your job well, closing is
      simply the natural next step.

        <strong>Key insight:</strong> You're not convincing them to do something

    <h2>👀 Recognizing Buying Signals</h2>
    <p>Watch for these signs they're ready to move forward:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Asking about the process details</li>
      <li>Asking about timeline</li>
      <li>Asking what they need to provide</li>
      <li>Tone becomes more relaxed</li>
      <li>They start using "when" instead of "if"</li>
      <li>They mention what they'll do with the money</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Closing Techniques</h2>

    <h3>1. The Assumptive Close</h3>
    <p>Assume they're moving forward and proceed accordingly.</p>
    <pre><code>"Great! Let me get your information so we can get 
started. What's the best email address to send the 
paperwork to?"</code></pre>

    <h3>2. The Summary Close</h3>
    <p>Summarize the benefits and ask for commitment.</p>
    <pre><code>"So to recap: there's approximately $[Amount] waiting 
for you. I handle all the paperwork and filing. You 
pay nothing unless I'm successful, and you'll receive 
your funds in about [Timeframe].

Ready to get started?"</code></pre>

    <h3>3. The Alternative Close</h3>
    <p>Give them a choice between two positive options.</p>
    <pre><code>"Would you prefer to sign the paperwork electronically 
today, or would you rather I mail you a physical copy?"</code></pre>

    <h3>4. The Direct Close</h3>
    <p>Simply ask for the business.</p>
    <pre><code>"Based on everything we've discussed, are you ready 
to move forward with recovering your funds?"</code></pre>

    <h3>5. The Urgency Close</h3>
    <p>Use legitimate time factors.</p>
    <pre><code>"The escheatment deadline for your funds is [Date]. 
To make sure we have plenty of time, I'd recommend 
we get started this week. Can we do that?"</code></pre>

    <h3>6. The Trial Close</h3>
    <p>Test their readiness before the final ask.</p>
    <pre><code>"How does everything sound so far? Do you have any 
other questions before we proceed?"</code></pre>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Talking past the close:</strong> Once they say yes, stop
            selling
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not asking:</strong> You must actually ask for the business
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Giving up too early:</strong> Most sales happen after 5+
            contacts
          </li>
          <li><strong>Being pushy:</strong> Pressure creates resistance</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not handling objections:</strong> Address concerns, don't
            ignore them
