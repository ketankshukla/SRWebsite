About the author

Ketan Shukla is a relentless questioner, a passionate advocate for
critical thinking, and a dedicated explorer of the human mind. With a
background that spans philosophy, cognitive science, software
engineering and years of practical observation of human behavior, Ketan
brings a unique perspective to the examination of belief systems and
their impact on our lives.

For over fifteen years, Ketan has been on a mission to understand why we
believe what we believe, and how these beliefs shape our reality. His
journey has taken him from the halls of academia to the streets of
diverse cultures, always seeking to uncover the hidden assumptions that
guide human behavior.

Ketan\'s work is characterized by its unflinching forthrightness, its
willingness to challenge even the most deeply held convictions, and its
ultimate goal of intellectual liberation. He understands that true
freedom comes not from finding the \"right\" beliefs, but from
developing the ability to think critically.

Ketan has inspired many people to question their assumptions and engage
more directly with reality. His thoughts on critical thinking and belief
deconstruction have been praised for their ability to spark profound
personal transformations.

\"Destroy Your Beliefs: By Using Your Intelligence\" is the magnum opus
of Ketan\'s life\'s work, distilling years of research, observation, and
personal exploration into a powerful guide for those ready to break free
from the invisible cages of unexamined beliefs.

When not writing, Ketan can be found engaging in spirited debates with
friends and strangers alike, always eager to have his own ideas
challenged and refined. He lives with his wife, Nimisha, whose
unwavering support and willingness to question everything alongside him
has been instrumental in bringing this book to life.

Ketan\'s work continues to evolve, always pushing the boundaries of what
we think we know. To stay updated on his latest insights and upcoming
