    <h2>🎯 The Opening Script</h2>

    <h3>Version 1: Direct Approach</h3>
    <pre><code>"Hi, is this [First Name]?"
[Wait for confirmation]

"[First Name], my name is [Your Name] calling from 
[Company]. I'm reaching out because there may be 
money owed to you from your former property at 
[Address]. Do you have a quick minute?"</code></pre>

    <h3>Version 2: Softer Approach</h3>
    <pre><code>"Hi, is this [First Name]?"
[Wait for confirmation]

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm calling 
with some potentially good news about your former 
property on [Street Name]. Is this a good time for 
a quick call?"</code></pre>

    <hr />

    <h2>💬 The Core Message</h2>

    <pre><code>"When your property was sold at [auction/foreclosure], 
it sold for more than what was owed. That extra money—
called surplus funds—legally belongs to you.

I specialize in helping people recover these funds. 
There's approximately $[Amount] that may be waiting 
for you.

I handle all the paperwork and filing. You don't pay 
anything unless I successfully recover your money."</code></pre>

    <hr />

    <h2>🔄 Handling Initial Responses</h2>

    <h3>If They're Interested:</h3>
    <pre><code>"Great! Let me explain how this works. I'll need to 
verify a few things and then I can send you the 
paperwork. The whole process takes about [X] weeks.

Can I confirm your current mailing address?"</code></pre>

    <h3>If They're Skeptical:</h3>
    <pre><code>"I completely understand your hesitation. You can 
verify this yourself by calling [County] at [Number] 
and asking about surplus funds for [Property Address].

Would you like me to give you that information so 
you can check?"</code></pre>

    <h3>If They Say No:</h3>
    <pre><code>"I understand. Before I go, I just want you to know 
there's approximately $[Amount] that belongs to you. 
If you change your mind, you can reach me at [Number].

Would it be okay if I sent you some information to 
review when you have time?"</code></pre>

    <hr />

    <h2>📱 Voicemail Script</h2>
    <pre><code>"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. 
I'm calling about surplus funds from your former 
property at [Address]. There may be money owed to you.

Please call me back at [Number]. Again, that's 
[Your Name] at [Number]. Thank you."</code></pre>
