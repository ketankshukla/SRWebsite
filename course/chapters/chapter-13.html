    <h2>🧠 Why People Object to Fees</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They don't understand the value you provide</li>
      <li>They think they can do it themselves</li>
      <li>They're comparing to other options</li>
      <li>They're negotiating</li>
      <li>They genuinely can't afford it (rare—it's contingency)</li>

    <h2>💬 Fee Objection Responses</h2>

    <h3>"Your fee is too high"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I understand the fee seems significant. Let me 
share some perspective:

Without help, most people never claim these funds—
they eventually go to the government. So the choice 
is really:

Option A: Keep 100% of $0
Option B: Keep 70% of $[Amount] = $[Net Amount]

Plus, you pay nothing unless I'm successful. There's 
zero risk to you.

Which option sounds better?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Why should I pay you when I can do it myself?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"You absolutely can try it yourself. Here's what's 
involved:

1. Gather proof of identity and ownership
2. Obtain the correct claim forms
3. File with the right department
4. Follow up regularly for 2-4 months
5. Handle any complications or rejections

Many people start themselves and call me when they 
hit obstacles. I'm happy to give you the county 
contact info if you'd like to try first.

Or, I can handle everything for you and you just 
wait for your check. What would you prefer?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Can you lower your fee?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I appreciate you asking. My fee reflects the work 
involved and the expertise I bring.

Consider this: I've successfully recovered funds 
for [X] clients. I know exactly what each county 
requires and how to avoid delays.

A lower-fee company might take longer or make 
mistakes that cost you money.

My fee is [X]%, and I'm confident you'll find it's 
worth it for a smooth, successful recovery.

Shall we proceed?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"What if you don't recover anything?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Great question—and this is important:

If I don't recover your funds, you pay nothing. 
Zero. Not a penny.

I only get paid when YOU get paid. That means I'm 
fully motivated to make this work.

This is a no-risk situation for you. Does that 
help address your concern?"</code></pre>
