      Deep dive into handling objections related to trust, legitimacy, and

    <h2>🔑 Why Trust is Everything</h2>
    <p>
      Trust objections are the most common and most important to handle well.
      These people have been through trauma and are naturally suspicious.
    </p>

    <h3>The Trust Equation</h3>
    <pre><code>Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Interest</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Credibility:</strong> Do you know what you're talking about?
      </li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Will you do what you say?</li>
      <li><strong>Intimacy:</strong> Do you care about them?</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Interest:</strong> Are you just in it for the money?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Trust Objection Responses</h2>

    <h3>"This sounds like a scam"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I completely understand—you should be careful. 
Scammers are out there, and I'm glad you're cautious.

Here's the difference: I'm not asking for any money 
upfront. I only get paid if I successfully recover 
YOUR money.

To verify I'm legitimate:
• Call [County] at [Number] about surplus funds
• Look up my company at [Website]
• Check our Google reviews

Would you like me to wait while you verify?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"How do I know you won't steal my money?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"That's a fair concern. Here's how the process works:

The county sends the check directly to YOU, not me. 
I never touch your money. After you receive it, 
you pay my fee.

This is all spelled out in our contract, which you 
can have reviewed by anyone you trust before signing.

Does that address your concern?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"I've never heard of this before"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Most people haven't—that's actually why so much 
money goes unclaimed. Counties don't actively 
search for former owners.

This is completely legitimate. In fact, [State] law 
requires counties to hold these funds for rightful 
owners. You can verify this on the county website.

Would you like me to send you some information?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Other people have contacted me about this"</h3>
    <pre><code>"That's not surprising—when there's money available, 
multiple companies may reach out.

The question is: who do you trust to handle it?

I'd encourage you to:
• Check reviews for any company you consider
• Verify they're a registered business
• Compare fee structures
• See who answers your questions best

What questions can I answer for you?"</code></pre>
