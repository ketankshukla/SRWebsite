    <h2>💬 Timing Objection Responses</h2>

    <h3>"I don't have time right now"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I completely understand—life is busy. Here's the 
good news: this takes very little of YOUR time.

All I need is about 15 minutes to gather some basic 
information and get your signature. After that, I 
handle everything.

Could we schedule a quick call for later this week 
when you have 15 minutes?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Call me back later"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I'd be happy to. When would be a better time?

[If vague] "Would tomorrow afternoon work, or is 
later this week better?"

[Schedule specific time]

"Great, I'll call you [Day] at [Time]. In the 
meantime, feel free to verify this with [County] 
at [Number]."</code></pre>

    <h3>"I need to think about it"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Of course—this is an important decision. 

What specifically would you like to think about? 
Maybe I can provide more information to help.

[Listen and address concerns]

Would it help if I sent you some written information 
to review?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"How long does this take?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Great question. Here's the typical timeline:

• Initial paperwork: 15-30 minutes of your time
• Filing the claim: I do this within a week
• County processing: Usually 30-90 days
• You receive funds: Shortly after approval

The sooner we start, the sooner you get your money. 
Shall we begin the paperwork today?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Is there a deadline?"</h3>
    <pre><code>"Yes, actually. In [State], unclaimed surplus funds 
can escheat (transfer) to the government after 
[X years].

Your property was sold on [Date], so we have until 
approximately [Deadline Date].

I recommend we start soon to avoid any issues. 
Can we begin today?"</code></pre>
