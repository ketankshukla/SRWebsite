    <h2>💰 What Are Surplus Funds?</h2>
    <p>
      When a property is sold at a foreclosure auction, tax sale, or sheriff's
      sale, it sometimes sells for more than what was owed on the mortgage,
      taxes, and liens. This excess amount is called
      <strong>surplus funds</strong> (also known as "overages" or "excess
      proceeds").
    </p>

    <h3>Example Scenario</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Item</th>
          <th>Amount</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Property sold at auction</td>
          <td>$250,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mortgage balance owed</td>
          <td>$180,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Back taxes</td>
          <td>$8,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HOA liens</td>
          <td>$5,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Legal fees</td>
          <td>$7,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Total owed</strong></td>
          <td><strong>$200,000</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background: rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.1)">
          <td><strong>✨ Surplus funds</strong></td>

      The former homeowner is legally entitled to this $50,000, but many don't
      know it exists or don't know how to claim it.

    <h2>❓ Why Do Surplus Funds Go Unclaimed?</h2>

    <h3>1. Lack of Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      Most homeowners don't know surplus funds exist. They assume they lost
      everything in the foreclosure.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Emotional Trauma</h3>
    <p>
      Foreclosure is devastating. Many people want to forget the experience and
      don't investigate further.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Relocation</h3>
    <p>
      Former homeowners often move, and notification letters don't reach them.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Complex Bureaucracy</h3>
    <p>
      The claims process varies by county and state. It can be confusing and
      intimidating.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Time Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions have deadlines (often 1-5 years) after which funds
      escheat to the government.
    </p>

    <h2>📊 The Size of the Opportunity</h2>

    <h3>National Statistics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Billions of dollars</strong> in surplus funds go unclaimed
        annually
      </li>
      <li>
        Average surplus amount: <strong>$5,000 - $50,000</strong> (varies
        widely)
      </li>
      <li>Some claims exceed <strong>$100,000+</strong></li>
      <li>
        Most counties have <strong>dozens to hundreds</strong> of unclaimed
        surplus accounts
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why This Business Works</h3>
    <div class="info-box tip">
      <span class="info-box-icon">💡</span>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Win-win situation:</strong> You help people recover money
            they didn't know they had
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No upfront cost to clients:</strong> You work on contingency
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recurring opportunity:</strong> New foreclosures happen
            constantly
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low competition:</strong> Most people don't know this
            industry exists
          </li>
          <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Can be systematized and outsourced</li>

    <h2>🏠 Types of Surplus Funds</h2>

    <h3>1. Mortgage Foreclosure Surplus</h3>
    <p>

      balance plus costs.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Tax Sale Surplus</h3>
    <p>
      When a property is sold for delinquent property taxes and sells for more
      than the taxes owed.
    </p>

    <h3>3. HOA Foreclosure Surplus</h3>
    <p>
      When a homeowners association forecloses for unpaid dues and the sale
      generates excess funds.

      <li><strong>Heirs</strong> (if the owner is deceased)</li>
