    <h2>🔧 DIY Objection Responses</h2>

    <h3>"I can do this myself"</h3>
    <pre><code>"You absolutely can—and I encourage you to try if 
you prefer. Here's what's typically involved:

1. Contact [County] to get the claim forms
2. Gather proof of identity and former ownership
3. Obtain any required court documents
4. Complete and notarize the paperwork
5. Submit to the correct department
6. Follow up every 2-4 weeks
7. Handle any requests for additional documentation

Many people start this process and call me when 
they hit obstacles. I'm happy to give you the 
county's contact information.

Or, I can handle all of this for you. Which would 
you prefer?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"I'll just call the county myself"</h3>
    <pre><code>"That's a great first step! Here's the number: 
[County Phone Number].

When you call, ask about surplus funds for 
[Property Address]. They'll confirm the amount.

If you decide you'd like help with the paperwork 
and process, give me a call. I'm here to help 
whenever you're ready."</code></pre>

    <h2>👥 Competition Objection Responses</h2>

    <h3>"I'm already working with someone else"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I understand. May I ask how that's going?

[If going well] "Great! I hope they get you your 
money quickly."

[If issues] "I'm sorry to hear that. If things 
don't work out, I'd be happy to help. Here's my 
card/number."</code></pre>

    <h3>"Another company offered a lower fee"</h3>
    <pre><code>"I appreciate you sharing that. A few things to 
consider when comparing:

• Are they a registered, legitimate business?
• What do their reviews say?
• How long have they been doing this?
• What happens if there are complications?

Sometimes a lower fee comes with less experience 
or slower processing. My [X]% fee reflects my 
expertise and track record.

What's most important to you in choosing who to 
work with?"</code></pre>

    <h3>"Someone else contacted me first"</h3>
    <pre><code>"That's not uncommon—when there's money available, 
multiple companies may reach out.

Being first doesn't mean being best. I'd encourage 
you to compare:
• Reviews and reputation
• Fee structure
• Communication style
• Who answers your questions best

I'm confident in my service. What questions can I 
answer for you?"</code></pre>
