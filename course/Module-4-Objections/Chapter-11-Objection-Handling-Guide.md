# Chapter 11: The Complete Objection Handling Guide

## Mastering the Art of Overcoming Resistance

Objections are not rejections—they're requests for more information. Every objection is an opportunity to build trust and demonstrate value. This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for handling any objection you'll encounter.

---

## The Psychology of Objections

### Why People Object

1. **Fear**: Afraid of being scammed or making a mistake
2. **Confusion**: Don't understand the situation
3. **Distrust**: Don't trust you or the process
4. **Inertia**: Easier to say no than to act
5. **Past experience**: Been burned before
6. **Genuine concern**: Have a real issue that needs addressing

### The Hidden Meaning

| What They Say              | What They Often Mean                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "I'm not interested"       | "I don't understand or trust this yet" |
| "It sounds like a scam"    | "I need proof this is legitimate"      |
| "I need to think about it" | "I'm not convinced of the value"       |
| "I can do it myself"       | "I don't see why I need you"           |
| "Your fee is too high"     | "I don't understand what I'm getting"  |

## The 50 Most Common Objections

### Category 1: Trust and Legitimacy (1-10)

**1. "This sounds like a scam."**

```
"I completely understand why you'd be cautious—there are
unfortunately scammers out there. Let me give you ways to
verify this is real:

1. Call [County Office] at [number] and ask about surplus
   funds from [property address]
2. Look up my company at [website]
3. Check my reviews on [platform]

Would you like to verify before we continue?"
```

**2. "How do I know you're legitimate?"**

```
"Great question—you should verify. Here's my business
information: [provide details]. I'm registered with
[state/entity]. You can also check [verification method].

I've helped [X] people recover surplus funds. Would you
like references from past clients?"
```

**3. "I've never heard of surplus funds."**

```
"Most people haven't—that's actually why I'm in business.
When a property sells at foreclosure for more than what's
owed, the extra money belongs to the former owner. It's
held by the county until claimed.

Billions of dollars go unclaimed every year because people
don't know about it. You can verify this exists by calling
[county office]."
```

**4. "Why would there be money? I lost everything."**

```
"I know it feels that way, and I'm sorry for what you went
through. But here's what happened: your property sold for
$[sale price], and the total owed was $[amount owed].

The difference—approximately $[surplus]—is legally yours.
The county is required to hold it for you."
```

**5. "How did you get my information?"**

```
"Your information is part of public records related to the
property sale. Foreclosure records, property records, and
sale results are all public information.

I research these records specifically to find people who
have unclaimed funds. I'm not a debt collector or anything
like that—I'm reaching out because you have money coming."
```

**6. "Are you with the government?"**

```
"No, I'm not with the government. I'm a private surplus
funds recovery specialist. I help people navigate the
claims process to recover money that's rightfully theirs.

The government holds the funds, but they don't actively
help people claim them. That's where I come in."
```

**7. "Why should I trust you?"**

```
"You shouldn't trust me blindly—you should verify everything.
Here's what I suggest:

1. Verify the surplus exists with the county
2. Research my company online
3. Ask me any questions you have
4. Take time to think about it

I'm confident that once you verify, you'll see this is
legitimate. What would help you feel more comfortable?"
```

**8. "I've been scammed before."**

```
"I'm really sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, there are
bad actors out there, and it makes my job harder.

Here's how I'm different: I don't ask for any money upfront.
You only pay if I successfully recover your funds. And you
can verify everything I've told you independently.

What happened before, if you don't mind sharing?"
```

**9. "My lawyer/family member said to be careful."**

```
"That's good advice—you should be careful. I'd encourage
you to have them verify the surplus exists with the county.

If they'd like to speak with me directly, I'm happy to
answer their questions too. Would that be helpful?"
```

**10. "Send me something in writing first."**

```
"Absolutely, I can do that. What's the best address to
send information to?

I'll include details about the surplus funds, my company
information, and how the process works. After you've
reviewed it, I'll follow up to answer any questions."
```

### Category 2: Fee and Money Concerns (11-20)

**11. "Your fee is too high."**

```
"I understand the fee seems significant. Let me put it
in perspective:

Without my help, you'd need to research the process,
gather documents, file the claim correctly, and follow
up—which can take months and may result in rejection
if done incorrectly.

My fee covers all of that work, and you pay nothing
unless I'm successful. Would you rather have [70%] of
$[amount] or potentially nothing?"
```

**12. "Why should I pay you when I can do it myself?"**

```
"You absolutely can do it yourself—it's your right.
Here's what's involved:

[List the steps in your state]

Some people prefer to handle it themselves. Others
prefer to have an expert handle it while they focus
on other things. Which sounds better to you?"
```

**13. "Can you lower your fee?"**

```
"My fee reflects the work involved and the expertise
I bring. I've successfully recovered funds for many
clients at this rate.

What I can tell you is that my fee only applies if
I'm successful. If I don't recover your money, you
pay nothing. Does that help?"
```

**14. "I don't have money to pay you."**

```
"You don't need any money upfront. My fee comes out
of the funds I recover—you never pay out of pocket.

If I recover $[amount], my fee of [X]% would be
$[fee amount], and you'd receive $[net amount].
You're not risking anything."
```

**15. "What if you don't recover anything?"**

```
"If I'm not successful, you pay nothing. Zero. That's
the benefit of working on contingency—I only get paid
if you get paid.

I'm confident in my ability to recover your funds,
which is why I'm willing to take that risk."
```

**16. "How do I know you won't take the money and run?"**

```
"The funds don't come to me—they go directly to you
from the county. I never touch your money.

Once the claim is approved, the county issues a check
in your name. Then you pay my fee from those funds.
You're always in control of the money."
```

**17. "I want to wait and see if I can get it myself first."**

```
"That's completely your choice. I'd just mention that
the process can be time-consuming and there may be
deadlines involved.

If you decide to try on your own and run into issues,
feel free to reach back out. I'm here to help whenever
you're ready."
```

**18. "What exactly does your fee cover?"**

```
"Great question. My fee covers:

• Verifying and documenting your claim
• Gathering all required paperwork
• Preparing and filing the claim
• Following up with the county
• Handling any issues or requests
• Ensuring you receive your funds

Essentially, I handle everything from start to finish."
```

**19. "Other companies charge less."**

```
"There may be companies that charge less. I'd encourage
you to research them carefully—check reviews, verify
they're legitimate, and understand exactly what's included.

My fee reflects my experience and success rate. I've
recovered [amount/number] for clients, and I stand
behind my work. What matters most to you in choosing
who to work with?"
```

**20. "I need to check with my spouse/family first."**

```
"Of course—this is an important decision. Would it help
if I spoke with them directly to answer any questions?

Or I can send information for you both to review. What
works best for your situation?"
```

---

### Category 3: Timing and Process (21-30)

**21. "How long does this take?"**

```
"The timeline varies by county, but typically:

• Paperwork preparation: 1-2 weeks
• County processing: 30-90 days
• Total: Usually 2-4 months

I'll keep you updated throughout the process. Some
claims go faster, some take longer depending on the
county's workload."
```

**22. "I don't have time for this right now."**

```
"I understand you're busy. The good news is, I handle
all the work. Your involvement is minimal—mainly
signing documents and providing some information.

Most clients spend less than an hour total. Would
that be manageable for you?"
```

**23. "Can I think about it?"**

```
"Absolutely—take the time you need. This is an important
decision.

Can I ask what specifically you want to think about?
I might be able to address those concerns now and
help you make a more informed decision."
```

**24. "Call me back later."**

```
"I'm happy to do that. When would be a better time
for you?

[If they give a time] Great, I'll call you [day/time].
[If vague] How about [suggest specific time]?"
```

**25. "I'm dealing with other things right now."**

```
"I understand—life can be overwhelming. I'm sorry if
this is adding to your plate.

This money could actually help with whatever you're
dealing with. And I do all the work, so it's minimal
effort on your part. Would it help to have this
handled while you focus on other things?"
```

**26. "What do I need to do?"**

```
"Very little, actually. Here's the process:

1. Sign an authorization form (I'll prepare it)
2. Provide some basic information and ID
3. Sign the claim documents (I'll prepare these too)
4. Wait while I handle the rest
5. Receive your check

Most clients spend about an hour total on their part."
```

**27. "What paperwork is involved?"**

```
"The main documents are:

• Authorization for me to act on your behalf
• Claim form (I fill this out, you sign)
• Proof of identity (copy of ID)
• Proof of ownership (I usually obtain this)

I prepare everything and walk you through it. You
just need to review and sign."
```

**28. "Is there a deadline?"**

```
"Deadlines vary by state and county. In [state/county],
the deadline is typically [timeframe] from the sale date.

Your property sold on [date], so we have until
approximately [deadline]. I'd recommend starting
soon to ensure we don't miss it."
```

**29. "What happens after I sign?"**

```
"After you sign:

1. I verify all documentation
2. I file the claim with [county/court]
3. I follow up regularly on status
4. I handle any requests or issues
5. Once approved, you receive your check
6. You pay my fee from the proceeds

I'll keep you updated at each step."
```

**30. "Why are you contacting me now?"**

```
"I recently researched surplus funds in [county] and
found your name connected to unclaimed funds. I reach
out as soon as I find these opportunities because:

1. There may be deadlines
2. Other companies may contact you
3. The sooner we start, the sooner you get your money

Is now a good time to discuss this?"
```
