# Chapter 14: Timing and Process Objections

## Overcoming Delays and Hesitation

Timing objections often mask deeper concerns. When someone says "not now," they may mean "I'm not convinced yet." This chapter helps you uncover the real issues and move prospects forward.

---

## Understanding Timing Objections

### Why People Delay

1. **Overwhelmed**: Too much going on in life
2. **Uncertain**: Not fully convinced
3. **Avoidance**: Don't want to revisit painful memories
4. **Procrastination**: Natural human tendency
5. **Legitimate timing**: Actually busy right now
6. **Polite rejection**: Easier than saying no

### The Cost of Delay

Help prospects understand:

- Deadlines may exist (statute of limitations)
- Funds could escheat to the state
- Competitors may reach them
- The sooner started, the sooner paid

## Deep-Dive Timing Objection Responses

### "I don't have time right now"

**Why they say it:**

- Genuinely busy
- Thinks it requires significant effort
- Avoiding the topic

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge their busy life
2. Minimize perceived time commitment
3. Explain what you handle vs. what they do
4. Offer flexible scheduling

**Full Response:**

```
"I completely understand—everyone's busy these days.
Here's the good news: this requires very little of
your time.

I handle all the work. Your involvement is:
- One phone call or meeting to get started (15-20 min)
- Reviewing and signing documents (15-20 min)
- Providing a copy of your ID

That's it. Maybe an hour total, spread over a few weeks.

I can work around your schedule. Would early morning,
evening, or weekend work better for you?"
```

---

### "Call me back later"

**Why they say it:**

- Not a good time
- Need to process
- Polite brush-off

**Response Strategy:**

1. Agree to call back
2. Pin down a specific time
3. Confirm interest
4. Leave something to think about

**Full Response:**

```
"I'm happy to call back. When would be a better time?

[If they give a vague answer like "next week"]

How about [specific day] at [specific time]? I want to
make sure I reach you when it's convenient.

In the meantime, remember there's approximately $[amount]
waiting for you. I'll send you some information to review
before we talk again.

What's the best email to send that to?"
```

**If they won't commit to a time:**

```
"I understand. I'll try you again in a few days. But
please know this is real money that belongs to you.
If you have questions before then, my number is [number].

Have a great day."
```

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Why they say it:**

- Processing information
- Not fully convinced
- Uncertain about something specific

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect their need
2. Uncover the specific concern
3. Address if possible
4. Set concrete follow-up

**Full Response:**

```
"Of course—take the time you need. This is an important
decision.

Can I ask what specifically you want to think about?
Sometimes I can provide additional information that
helps with the decision."

[Listen carefully to their response]

[If they share a concern, address it]

[If they're vague:]
"That's fine. Let me send you some information to review.
I'll include details about the surplus funds, how the
process works, and how to verify everything.

Can I follow up with you on [specific day]? That gives
you a few days to think it over."
```

---

### "I'm dealing with other things right now"

**Why they say it:**

- Life challenges
- Emotional overwhelm
- Foreclosure trauma still fresh

**Response Strategy:**

1. Show empathy
2. Position your service as helpful, not burdensome
3. Offer to handle everything
4. Be patient but persistent

**Full Response:**

```
"I'm sorry to hear you're going through a difficult time.
I know this call brings up a painful topic.

Here's the thing: this money could actually help with
whatever you're dealing with. And I do all the work—
you don't have to think about it or deal with bureaucracy.

I can start the process now and just check in with you
when I need a signature. Would that be helpful?"

[If they're still hesitant:]

"I understand. When things settle down, please reach out.
This money will still be there. Here's my number: [number].

I wish you the best with everything."
```

### "How long does this take?"

**Why they say it:**

- Want to set expectations
- Concerned about lengthy process
- May be impatient for funds

**Response Strategy:**

1. Give honest timeline
2. Break down the phases
3. Explain what affects timing
4. Set realistic expectations

**Full Response:**

```
"Great question. Here's a realistic timeline:

Phase 1: Getting Started (1-2 weeks)
- We complete paperwork
- I gather documentation
- I prepare and file the claim

Phase 2: Processing (30-90 days)
- County reviews the claim
- May request additional information
- I follow up regularly

Phase 3: Payment (1-2 weeks after approval)
- Claim is approved
- Check is issued to you
- You receive your funds

Total: Usually 2-4 months from start to finish.

Some claims go faster, some take longer—it depends on
the county's workload and complexity of the case.

I'll keep you updated throughout the process. Does
that timeline work for you?"
```

---

### "Is there a deadline?"

**Why they say it:**

- Assessing urgency
- Planning when to act
- May be procrastinating

**Response Strategy:**

1. Provide accurate deadline information
2. Create appropriate urgency (without being pushy)
3. Explain consequences of missing deadline
4. Recommend acting sooner

**Full Response:**

```
"Yes, there are deadlines. In [state/county], you
typically have [X years] from the date of sale to
file a claim.

Your property sold on [date], so the deadline would
be approximately [deadline date].

After that deadline, the funds may escheat to the
state—meaning you could lose them permanently.

I'd recommend starting soon to ensure we have plenty
of time to complete the process. Would you like to
get started today?"
```

**If deadline is far away:**

```
"The deadline isn't immediate, but I'd still recommend
starting sooner rather than later. The process takes
time, and the sooner we start, the sooner you receive
your money.

Plus, if any issues come up, we'll have time to
address them. What do you think?"
```

---

### "I want to wait until after [event/date]"

**Why they say it:**

- Legitimate scheduling conflict
- Using as delay tactic
- Want to focus on other priorities

**Response Strategy:**

1. Understand the reason
2. Assess if waiting is risky
3. Offer to start now with minimal involvement
4. Schedule concrete follow-up

**Full Response:**

```
"I understand you have [event] coming up. Here's what
I'd suggest:

We could start the process now—I just need about 15
minutes of your time to get the paperwork signed. Then
I handle everything else while you focus on [event].

By the time [event] is over, we could already be well
into the process.

Would that work, or would you prefer I contact you
after [date]?"

[If they insist on waiting:]

"No problem. I'll put a reminder to contact you on
[date after event]. In the meantime, here's my contact
information if anything changes.

Enjoy [event]!"
```

---

### "What do I need to do?"

**Why they say it:**

- Interested but uncertain
- Assessing effort required
- Ready to move forward

**Response Strategy:**

1. Clearly outline their role
2. Minimize perceived effort
3. Emphasize what you handle
4. Move toward next steps

**Full Response:**

```
"Great question—and the answer is: not much!

Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Sign an authorization form (I'll prepare it)
2. Provide a copy of your ID
3. Sign the claim documents (I'll prepare these)
4. Cash your check when it arrives!

That's it. Maybe 30-60 minutes of your time total.

I handle everything else:
- Gathering documentation
- Preparing the claim
- Filing with the county
- Following up on status
- Resolving any issues

Ready to get started? I can email you the authorization
form right now."
```

---

### "What happens next?"

**Why they say it:**

- Want to understand the process
- Ready to move forward
- Need clarity before committing

**Response Strategy:**

1. Walk through the process step by step
2. Set clear expectations
3. Answer any questions
4. Transition to getting started

**Full Response:**

```
"Here's exactly what happens:

Step 1: Today
- I'll email you an authorization form
- You review, sign, and return it
- Send me a copy of your ID

Step 2: This Week
- I gather all required documentation
- I prepare the claim paperwork
- I send it to you for signature

Step 3: Next Week
- I file the claim with [county/court]
- I confirm receipt and get case number
- I update you on status

Step 4: Ongoing
- I follow up with the county regularly
- I handle any requests or issues
- I keep you informed of progress

Step 5: Completion
- Claim is approved
- Check is issued to you
- You pay my fee from the proceeds

Any questions about the process?"
```

## Creating Appropriate Urgency

### Legitimate Urgency Factors

Use these honestly—never fabricate urgency:

1. **Statutory deadlines**: Real time limits exist
2. **Escheatment**: Funds can go to the state
3. **Competition**: Others may contact them
4. **Processing time**: Sooner started = sooner paid
5. **Life circumstances**: Money could help now

### Urgency Language

**Do say:**

- "The deadline for claiming is [date]"
- "The sooner we start, the sooner you receive funds"
- "I'd hate for you to miss out on this money"
- "Other companies may contact you"

**Don't say:**

- "This is your last chance" (unless true)
- "You'll lose everything if you don't act now"
- "I can only help you today"
- Any false or exaggerated urgency

---

## Following Up on Timing Objections

### The Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1**: Initial contact
**Day 3**: Follow-up call/email
**Day 7**: Second follow-up
**Day 14**: Third follow-up
**Day 30**: Monthly check-in
**Ongoing**: Quarterly until deadline

### Follow-Up Scripts

**First follow-up:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] following up on our
conversation about the surplus funds from your property.
Have you had a chance to think about it? I'm happy to
answer any questions."
```

**Later follow-up:**

```
"Hi [Name], just checking in. The $[amount] in surplus
funds is still available. I wanted to make sure you
don't miss out. Is now a better time to discuss?"
```

**Final follow-up before deadline:**

```
"Hi [Name], I wanted to reach out one more time. The
deadline for claiming your surplus funds is approaching.
I'd hate for you to lose this money. Please call me at
[number] if you'd like to proceed."
```
