# Chapter 12: Trust and Credibility Objections

## Building Trust When They Don't Know You

Trust objections are the most common and most important to overcome. If prospects don't trust you, nothing else matters. This chapter provides deep-dive strategies for establishing credibility.

---

## Understanding Trust Objections

### Why Trust is the #1 Issue

1. **They've been through trauma**: Foreclosure victims are vulnerable
2. **Scammers exist**: They may have been targeted before
3. **It sounds too good**: "Free money" triggers skepticism
4. **You're a stranger**: No existing relationship
5. **Cold contact**: Unexpected outreach feels suspicious

### The Trust Equation

```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Interest

- Credibility: Do you know what you're talking about?
- Reliability: Will you do what you say?
- Intimacy: Do you care about them?
- Self-Interest: Are you just in it for yourself?
```

**Your goal**: Maximize the top three, minimize perceived self-interest.

## Deep-Dive Objection Responses

### "This sounds like a scam"

**Why they say it:**

- Protective instinct
- Past negative experiences
- Sounds too good to be true
- Unexpected contact

**Response Strategy:**

1. Validate their caution
2. Provide multiple verification methods
3. Explain how scams differ from your service
4. Offer to slow down and let them verify

**Full Response:**

```
"I completely understand why you'd think that, and honestly,
I'm glad you're being careful. There are scammers out there,
and you should protect yourself.

Here's how you can verify everything I've told you:

First, call [County Clerk/Treasurer] at [phone number]. Ask
them about surplus funds from the sale of [property address]
on [date]. They'll confirm the funds exist.

Second, look up my company. Our website is [website], we're
registered with [state entity], and you can find reviews at
[platform].

Third, notice that I'm not asking you for any money. Scammers
typically want payment upfront. I only get paid if I
successfully recover your funds.

Would you like to verify before we continue? I'm happy to
wait or call you back after you've checked."
```

**Follow-up if they're still hesitant:**

```
"I understand this is a lot to take in. How about this:
I'll send you information in writing, you can verify
everything at your own pace, and then decide.

There's no pressure. I just want to make sure you know
about this money. What's the best way to send you
information?"
```

---

### "How do I know you're not going to steal my money?"

**Why they say it:**

- Fear of financial loss
- Don't understand the process
- Past experiences with fraud

**Response Strategy:**

1. Explain the payment flow
2. Emphasize they control the money
3. Describe the legal protections
4. Offer documentation

**Full Response:**

```
"That's a really important question, and I want to address
it directly.

Here's how the money flows: The surplus funds are held by
[county/entity]. When the claim is approved, they issue a
check directly to YOU—not to me. I never touch your money.

Once you receive the check, you pay my fee from those funds.
You're always in control.

Additionally, our agreement is a legal contract. If I did
anything improper, you'd have legal recourse. But more
importantly, my business depends on my reputation. I've
helped [X] people recover funds, and I have reviews you
can check.

Does that help address your concern?"
```

### "I need to verify this is real"

**Why they say it:**

- Healthy skepticism
- Want proof before proceeding
- May have been burned before

**Response Strategy:**

1. Encourage verification
2. Provide specific instructions
3. Offer to wait or follow up
4. See this as a positive sign

**Full Response:**

```
"Absolutely—you should verify. I encourage it. Here's
exactly how to do it:

Call [County Office Name] at [phone number]. Tell them
you're inquiring about surplus funds from the foreclosure
sale of [property address] on [date]. Ask them:

1. Are there surplus funds from this sale?
2. What is the approximate amount?
3. Who is entitled to claim them?

They'll confirm everything I've told you.

Would you like to do that now while I wait, or should I
call you back after you've verified?"
```

**Pro tip:** If they verify while on the phone, you've essentially closed the trust gap.

### "Why should I trust you over other companies?"

**Why they say it:**

- May have received other contacts
- Comparing options
- Looking for differentiation

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge competition exists
2. Highlight your differentiators
3. Focus on their needs, not bashing competitors
4. Offer proof of your value

**Full Response:**

```
"That's a fair question. You may have other options, and
you should choose who you're most comfortable with.

Here's what I offer:

1. [X] years of experience in surplus funds recovery
2. A [X]% success rate on claims I take
3. Clear communication throughout the process
4. [Specific differentiator: local expertise, lower fee,
   faster processing, etc.]

I'm also happy to provide references from past clients
if that would help.

What's most important to you in choosing who to work with?"
```

---

### "My friend/family member says this is a scam"

**Why they say it:**

- Seeking validation from trusted sources
- Friend/family is protective
- May have shared incomplete information

**Response Strategy:**

1. Respect the advisor's concern
2. Offer to speak with them directly
3. Provide verification methods for them
4. Don't criticize the advisor

**Full Response:**

```
"I appreciate that you're getting advice from people you
trust. They're right to be cautious on your behalf.

Would it help if I spoke with them directly? I'm happy
to answer any questions they have and provide verification.

Alternatively, they can verify the surplus funds exist
by calling [county office] at [number]. Once they confirm
it's real, they might feel more comfortable.

What would be most helpful?"
```

---

### "I don't give out personal information to strangers"

**Why they say it:**

- Privacy concerns
- Fear of identity theft
- Protective instinct

**Response Strategy:**

1. Validate their caution
2. Explain what information you need and why
3. Describe your data protection practices
4. Offer alternatives

**Full Response:**

```
"I completely respect that, and you're smart to be careful
with your information.

At this stage, I don't need any sensitive information from
you. I already have the basic details from public records.

If you decide to move forward, I would need:
- A copy of your ID (to prove you're the rightful claimant)
- Your signature on the claim documents

I keep all information secure and confidential, and I only
use it for the purpose of filing your claim.

Would you like me to send you information first so you can
review everything before sharing anything?"
```

---

### "I've been contacted by other companies"

**Why they say it:**

- Overwhelmed by contacts
- Comparing options
- May be suspicious of the volume

**Response Strategy:**

1. Acknowledge this is common
2. Explain why multiple contacts happen
3. Differentiate yourself
4. Help them evaluate options

**Full Response:**

```
"That's not surprising—surplus funds are public record,
so multiple companies may have found your information.

Here's how I'd suggest evaluating your options:

1. Verify each company is legitimate
2. Compare fees and services
3. Check reviews and references
4. Go with whoever you feel most comfortable with

I'm confident in my service, but ultimately you should
choose who you trust most. What questions can I answer
to help you decide?"
```

---

### "Send me proof this is real"

**Why they say it:**

- Want documentation
- Need to see it in writing
- May share with advisor

**Response Strategy:**

1. Agree immediately
2. Ask for contact information
3. Describe what you'll send
4. Set follow-up expectation

**Full Response:**

```
"Absolutely, I'll send you documentation right away.

I'll include:
- Information about the surplus funds
- How to verify with the county
- Details about my company and services
- The next steps if you want to proceed

What's the best way to send this—email or mail?

[Get contact info]

I'll send that today and follow up in a few days to
answer any questions. Does that work?"
```

## Building Credibility Proactively

### Before They Object

**Establish credibility early:**

- Mention your company name and how long you've been in business
- Reference the specific property and details (shows research)
- Offer verification methods before they ask
- Be transparent about your fee upfront

**Example opening with built-in credibility:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company Name]. We've
been helping homeowners recover surplus funds for [X] years.

I'm calling about your former property at [specific address].
Our research shows there's approximately $[amount] in surplus
funds from the [date] sale.

You can verify this by calling [county] at [number]. I help
people navigate the claims process for a [X]% fee, paid only
if I'm successful.

Do you have a few minutes to discuss this?"
```

---

## Trust-Building Tools

### Verification Resources to Provide

Create a one-page document with:

- County office contact information
- What to ask when they call
- Your company information
- How to research you online
- FAQ about surplus funds

### Social Proof Elements

- Testimonials from past clients
- Case studies (anonymized if needed)
- Reviews on Google, BBB, etc.
- Professional affiliations
- Media mentions (if any)

### Professional Presence

- Professional website
- Business email (not Gmail)
- LinkedIn profile
- Google Business listing
- BBB registration

## When Trust Can't Be Built

### Signs to Move On

- Repeated accusations despite verification offered
- Hostile or aggressive responses
- Refusal to engage in any conversation
- Explicit request to stop contacting

### Graceful Exit

```
"I understand you're not comfortable, and I respect that.
I'll leave you with my contact information in case you
change your mind. The surplus funds will still be there
if you decide to pursue them later.

Thank you for your time, and I wish you the best."
```
