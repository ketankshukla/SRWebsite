Welcome back. This is Chapter 21, and we're covering how to train your VA team.

Good training is the difference between a VA who struggles and one who excels. Let's set your team up for success.

SOP stands for Standard Operating Procedure. These are step-by-step instructions that enable anyone to perform a task consistently.

A good SOP includes: The purpose of the task and why it matters. When to perform the task. Tools needed. Step-by-step instructions with screenshots. A quality checklist. Common mistakes to avoid. And who to contact with questions.

Document everything. If you do a task more than once, it should have an SOP.

Here's a simple SOP template you can use.

Start with the task name as the title.

Purpose section: Explain why this task is done and what it accomplishes.

When to perform section: Describe the triggers or schedule for this task.

Tools needed section: List all tools and access required.

Step-by-step instructions section: Break down each step with detailed explanations and screenshots where helpful.

Quality checklist section: List items to verify before marking complete.

Common mistakes section: Describe errors to avoid and how to prevent them.

Questions section: Provide contact information for help.

Use multiple methods to train effectively.

Written SOPs are best for reference material. Use Google Docs or Notion.

Video tutorials are best for visual processes. Use Loom or Screencast to record yourself doing the task.

Live training is best for complex topics and Q&A. Use Zoom or Google Meet.

Practice exercises are best for skill verification. Create sample tasks they can practice on.

Combine all four methods for comprehensive training.

Here's a recommended training schedule.

Week 1 is Foundation. Days 1 and 2 cover company overview, role explanation, and tool setup. Days 3 and 4 cover core task training with SOPs and videos. Day 5 includes practice exercises and assessment.

Week 2 is Supervised Practice. Assign real tasks with daily review. Have daily check-in calls. Provide immediate feedback. Gradually increase independence.

Weeks 3 and 4 are Increasing Independence. Assign more tasks with less supervision. Move to weekly review meetings. Address issues as they arise.

Quality control ensures work meets your standards.

For research tasks, spot-check 10 to 20 percent of entries for accuracy.

For calling tasks, listen to recorded calls and score them.

For admin tasks, review completed documents before they go out.

Catch errors early. It's easier to correct habits in the first few weeks than after months of doing it wrong.

Use the SBI framework for giving feedback.

S is for Situation. When and where did this happen?

B is for Behavior. What specifically did they do?

I is for Impact. What was the result?

Here's an example: "Yesterday when you were skip tracing, you used results with confidence scores below 70 percent. This could lead to us contacting wrong people. Going forward, please only use results with 70 percent or higher confidence."

Be specific, not vague. Focus on behavior, not personality.

Training doesn't stop after onboarding.

Hold weekly one-on-ones to discuss performance and challenges.

Update SOPs when processes change or you find better methods.

Share wins and learnings with the team.

Provide growth opportunities as they master current tasks.

Invest in your team's development, and they'll invest in your business.

Let's recap. Create detailed SOPs for every task. Use multiple training methods. Follow a structured training schedule. Implement quality control checks. Provide regular, constructive feedback. Commit to continuous improvement.

Your action items: Create an SOP template. Write SOPs for your top 3 tasks. Record video tutorials for complex processes. Design your training schedule. Set up a quality control system.

In the next chapter, we'll cover tools and software for automation.

See you there.
