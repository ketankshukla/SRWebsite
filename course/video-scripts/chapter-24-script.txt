Welcome back. This is Chapter 24, and we're covering how to hire and manage callers.

Your calling team is the engine of your outreach. Let's build it right.

There are three types of callers you might hire.

Cold Callers make initial contact and qualify interest. They need resilience and the ability to follow scripts.

Appointment Setters qualify leads and schedule callbacks for you. They need qualification skills and calendar management.

Closers convert qualified leads into signed clients. They need objection handling skills and closing ability.

Most businesses start with cold callers or appointment setters, with you handling the closing.

Choose the calling model that fits your situation.

Model 1: You Close Everything. The caller qualifies and transfers to you. You close. Best for starting out and high-value leads.

Model 2: Appointment Setting. The caller qualifies and schedules a callback. You call and close. Best when you can't take live transfers.

Model 3: Full Sales Team. The caller qualifies. A closer closes. You oversee. Best for maximum scale.

Start with Model 1 or 2, then evolve to Model 3 as you grow.

Find callers through these channels.

Filipino callers often provide the best value for cold calling roles.

Follow this hiring process.

Create a detailed job posting with responsibilities, requirements, hours, and compensation.

Screen applications for communication quality and relevant experience.

Conduct voice tests. Have candidates record themselves reading your script. This reveals their phone presence.

Interview top candidates via video call.

Do a paid trial of 2 to 4 hours of actual calling.

Hire the best performer.

The voice test and paid trial are critical. Don't skip them.

Train your callers thoroughly.

Day 1: Company overview and what surplus funds are.

Day 2: Scripts and the calling process.

Day 3: Objection handling and role playing.

Day 4: Systems and tools training.

Day 5: Supervised calling with real leads.

Week 2: Monitored independence with daily feedback.

Don't rush training. A well-trained caller produces far better results.

Track these metrics for each caller.

Calls per hour: Target 15 to 25 dials.

Contact rate: Target 20 to 30% of dials.

Qualification rate: Target 20 to 30% of conversations.

Transfer or appointment rate: Target 50 to 70% of qualified leads.

Close rate on their leads: Track how their leads convert.

Review metrics weekly. Identify what's working and what needs improvement.

Here are two compensation models.

Base Plus Commission: Base of $10 per hour. Plus $10 per qualified transfer. Plus $50 to $100 per signed deal.

Hourly Plus Bonus: $12 per hour. Weekly bonus of $100 for hitting targets. Monthly bonus of $200 for top performer.

Align incentives with results. Pay for what you want more of.

Address these common issues.

Low contact rates: Check data quality and calling times.

Poor conversations: Review calls and provide coaching.

High turnover: Improve training, compensation, or culture.

Inconsistent performance: Implement daily check-ins and accountability.

Script deviation: Reinforce training and monitor calls.

Most problems are solved with better training, clearer expectations, or improved systems.

Let's recap. Choose the right calling model for your stage. Hire carefully with voice tests and trials. Train thoroughly before independent calling. Track metrics and provide regular feedback. Compensate fairly with performance incentives.

Your action items: Decide on your calling model. Create your caller job posting. Build your training curriculum. Set up call tracking and metrics. Design your compensation structure.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into commission structures and compensation.

See you there.
