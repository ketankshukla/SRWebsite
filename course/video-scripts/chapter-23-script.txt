Welcome to Module 7 of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 23, and we're exploring the owner-operator model.

This is how you build a business you can step back from while maintaining quality and profitability.

Let's dive in.

Let me show you the difference between the traditional model and the owner-operator model.

In the traditional model, you do everything. You research, you do outreach, you close, you file claims, and you get paid. You're trading time for money.

In the owner-operator model, you supervise. Your team does the research, outreach, closing, claims, and you oversee everything. You're building an asset.

The goal is to transition from doing the work to managing the work.

Here's what the organizational structure looks like.

You're at the top as the owner.

Below you, you have a Research Team with research VAs.

You have an Outreach Team with callers and a mail coordinator.

You have a Claims Team with claims processors.

And you may have Closers, which might be you initially or dedicated closers later.

You don't need all of this on day one. Build it gradually.

Let me walk you through the phases of building your team.

Phase 1 is Foundation, months 1 through 3. It's you plus one research VA. Investment is about $500 to $800 per month. Capacity is 50 to 100 leads per month.

Phase 2 is Growth, months 4 through 6. It's you plus research VA plus a caller. Investment is about $1,500 to $2,500 per month. Capacity is 150 to 300 leads per month.

Phase 3 is Scale, months 7 through 12. It's you plus a full team. Investment is about $4,000 to $8,000 per month. Capacity is 500 or more leads per month.

Phase 4 is Freedom, year 2 and beyond. You're a true owner-operator. Investment is $10,000 or more per month. Capacity is unlimited.

Let's look at the economics at different scales.

At 2 deals per month with $15,000 revenue and $2,000 team cost, your net profit is $12,000.

At 5 deals per month with $37,500 revenue and $8,000 team cost, your net profit is $27,500.

At 10 deals per month with $75,000 revenue and $15,000 team cost, your net profit is $55,000.

At 20 deals per month with $150,000 revenue and $30,000 team cost, your net profit is $110,000.

This assumes an average fee of $7,500 per deal. The leverage of a team dramatically increases your earning potential.

As an owner-operator, your role shifts to high-value activities.

You focus on closing deals, which is the highest-value activity.

You manage and develop your team.

You ensure quality control across all operations.

You make strategic decisions about growth and direction.

You build relationships with key partners and clients.

You're working on the business, not just in the business.

Track these KPIs to manage your business effectively.

Leads researched: Target 200 or more per week.

Contact rate: Target 30% or higher.

Close rate: Target 20% or higher.

Deals signed: Target 5 or more per month.

Profit margin: Target 60% or higher.

Review these weekly and monthly. They tell you where to focus improvement efforts.

You need these systems to operate effectively.

Lead management system: Your CRM tracking every lead through the pipeline.

Communication system: How your team communicates and shares information.

Quality control system: How you verify work meets standards.

Training system: How you onboard and develop team members.

Financial system: How you track revenue, expenses, and profitability.

Document everything. Systems enable scaling.

Let's recap. The owner-operator model lets you supervise rather than do. Build your team gradually in phases. Create systems before hiring. Track KPIs to manage effectively. Your role shifts to high-value activities.

Your action items: Define your ideal owner-operator role. Calculate economics for your target scale. Document your current processes. Create a management dashboard. Plan your team-building phases.

In the next chapter, we'll cover hiring and managing callers.

See you there.
