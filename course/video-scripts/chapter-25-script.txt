CHAPTER 25: COMMISSION STRUCTURES AND COMPENSATION
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 8-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 25, and we're diving deep into commission structures and compensation.

Getting this right motivates your team and ensures profitability. Let's design your compensation system.

---

[SCENE 2 - COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY]
Your compensation structure should be five things.

Fair: Competitive with market rates.

Motivating: Rewards good performance.

Aligned: Team wins when the business wins.

Sustainable: Business remains profitable.

Clear: Everyone understands how they're paid.

If your structure doesn't meet all five criteria, it needs work.

---

[SCENE 3 - COMPENSATION MODELS]
There are three main compensation models.

Model 1 is Straight Hourly. Fixed hourly rate with no performance pay. It's simple to manage and predictable, but provides no performance incentive. Best for administrative roles and training periods.

Model 2 is Hourly Plus Commission. Base hourly rate plus commission on results. It provides strong incentive while offering stability, but is more complex to track. Best for callers and appointment setters.

Model 3 is Commission Only. No base pay, 100% commission. Zero cost if no results and maximum alignment, but it's hard to find good people willing to take this risk. Best for experienced closers.

---

[SCENE 4 - ROLE-SPECIFIC COMPENSATION]
Let me give you specific numbers for each role.

For Research VAs: Base hourly of $5 to $10. Weekly quality bonus of $25 to $50. Monthly performance bonus of $50 to $100.

For Cold Callers: Base hourly of $8 to $15. Per qualified transfer of $10 to $25. Per deal closed of $25 to $75.

For Closers: Base if any of $15 to $25 per hour. Per deal closed of $200 to $500. Or a percentage of 5 to 15% of the fee.

Adjust based on your market and the results you're seeing.

---

[SCENE 5 - DESIGNING YOUR STRUCTURE]
Here's how to design your compensation structure.

Step 1: Know your numbers. What's your average fee collected? What are your direct costs? What's your gross margin per deal?

Step 2: Allocate to roles. What percentage of each deal goes to research, calling, closing, claims, overhead, and your profit?

Step 3: Work backwards. If research gets 2% of a $7,500 fee, that's $150 per deal. How many deals does a researcher support? That determines their effective compensation.

---

[SCENE 6 - EXAMPLE ALLOCATION]
Let me show you an example allocation for a $7,500 average fee.

Research gets 2%, which is $150.

Calling gets 3%, which is $225.

Closing gets 10%, which is $750.

Claims processing gets 2%, which is $150.

Overhead is 10%, which is $750.

Your profit is 73%, which is $5,475.

This is just an example. Adjust based on your actual costs and market rates.

---

[SCENE 7 - TRACKING AND PAYMENT]
Track compensation accurately.

Use a spreadsheet or software to track every deal and who contributed.

Document the compensation formula clearly so there are no disputes.

Pay on a consistent schedule, whether weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.

Provide statements showing how compensation was calculated.

Transparency builds trust with your team.

---

[SCENE 8 - COMMON MISTAKES]
Avoid these compensation mistakes.

Paying too little and losing good people.

Paying too much and destroying profitability.

Complicated structures that confuse your team.

Misaligned incentives that reward the wrong behaviors.

Inconsistent payment that damages trust.

Changing structures too often without good reason.

Get it right from the start, then adjust based on data.

---

[SCENE 9 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Choose a compensation model based on the role. Balance base pay with performance incentives. Know your numbers before setting commissions. Track everything transparently. Review and adjust based on results.

Your action items: Calculate your per-deal economics. Design compensation for each role. Create a commission tracking system. Document your pay policies clearly. Review quarterly and adjust as needed.

In the next chapter, we'll cover quality control and supervision.

See you there.
