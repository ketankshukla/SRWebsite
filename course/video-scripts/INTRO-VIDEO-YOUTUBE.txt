DESCRIPTION (Copy everything below this line)
================================================================

Did you lose your home to foreclosure? You may have thousands of dollars waiting for you — and not even know it.

When a foreclosed property sells at auction for MORE than what was owed on the mortgage, the extra money is called "surplus funds" (also known as excess proceeds or overages). That money legally belongs to YOU, the former homeowner.

In this video, Ketan Shukla from Surplus Recoveries explains:

✅ What surplus funds are and how they're created
✅ Why billions of dollars go unclaimed every year
✅ How to find out if YOU have money waiting
✅ The 7-step claims process (and why it's so complicated)
✅ 12 challenges of trying to recover funds yourself
✅ How Surplus Recoveries handles everything for you
✅ Our simple 4-step process with zero upfront fees
✅ Important deadlines you can't afford to miss

🏛️ SUPREME COURT RULING: In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Tyler v. Hennepin County that homeowners are entitled to surplus funds from foreclosure sales. The law is on your side.

⏰ TIME-SENSITIVE: Most states have strict deadlines for claiming surplus funds — ranging from 60 days to 5 years. Don't wait until it's too late.
