CHAPTER 9: DIRECT MAIL CAMPAIGNS
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 8-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 9, and we're covering direct mail campaigns.

Direct mail is one of the most effective ways to reach foreclosure victims, especially those who are hard to reach by phone.

Let's explore how to create mail pieces that get opened, read, and responded to.

---

[SCENE 2 - WHY DIRECT MAIL WORKS]
Direct mail works for several important reasons.

First, it's tangible. A physical letter feels more legitimate than a phone call from a stranger.

Second, it's persistent. A letter sits on their counter. They might read it today, tomorrow, or next week.

Third, it's less intrusive. People can read it on their own time without feeling pressured.

Fourth, it bypasses gatekeepers. Unlike calls that go to voicemail, mail gets delivered directly.

Fifth, it builds credibility. A professional letter with your company information establishes legitimacy.

---

[SCENE 3 - TYPES OF MAIL PIECES]
There are several types of mail pieces you can use.

Personal letters in a standard envelope look like personal correspondence and have high open rates.

Official-looking letters with your company letterhead convey professionalism and legitimacy.

Postcards are cheaper to send and the message is immediately visible, but they feel less personal.

Certified mail guarantees delivery and creates urgency, but it's more expensive.

For most situations, I recommend starting with personal letters. They have the best balance of cost and effectiveness.

---

[SCENE 4 - LETTER TEMPLATE]
Here's a proven letter template you can adapt.

Start with their name and address at the top, then the date.

The opening paragraph: "I'm writing to inform you about money that may be owed to you from the sale of your former property at [Address]. After the foreclosure sale, there were excess funds remaining, and you may be entitled to claim them."

The middle paragraph: "Based on my research, there is approximately [Amount] in surplus funds being held by [County Name]. These funds belong to you, but they won't be sent automatically. You need to file a claim to receive them."

The next paragraph: "I specialize in helping former homeowners recover these funds. I handle all the paperwork and deal with the county on your behalf. My fee is [X]%, and I only get paid if I successfully recover your money. If I don't recover anything, you owe nothing."

The closing: "Please call me at [Phone] or email me at [Email] to discuss your options. I'm happy to answer any questions and send you documentation proving these funds exist. Sincerely, [Your Name], [Your Company]."

[SCENE 5 - DESIGN BEST PRACTICES]
Follow these design best practices for better results.

Use a real stamp, not a meter. Hand-addressed envelopes get opened more often than printed labels.

Keep the letter to one page. People won't read long letters.

Use simple, clear language. Write at an 8th-grade reading level.

Include your contact information prominently. Phone, email, and website.

Add a call to action. Tell them exactly what to do next.

Consider including a simple one-page FAQ or information sheet.

---

[SCENE 6 - MULTI-TOUCH CAMPAIGN]
One letter usually isn't enough. Plan a multi-touch campaign.

Week 1: Send your first letter introducing yourself and the surplus funds.

Week 3: Send a follow-up letter. Reference your first letter and add urgency.

Week 5: Send a different format, like a postcard, with a simple reminder.

Week 7: Send a final letter. Mention this is your last attempt to reach them.

Throughout this time, also attempt phone calls. The combination of mail and calls is more effective than either alone.

---

[SCENE 7 - TRACKING AND TESTING]
Track your direct mail results carefully.

Calculate your response rate. This is the number of responses divided by letters sent. A 2 to 5% response rate is typical.

Track cost per response. Divide total mail costs by number of responses.

Test different approaches. Try different headlines, letter lengths, or envelope styles. Send version A to half your list and version B to the other half.

Keep records of what works. Over time, you'll develop a winning formula for your market.

---

[SCENE 8 - COST CONSIDERATIONS]
Let's talk about costs.

Stamps cost about 68 cents for first class or 53 cents for presorted if you're sending volume.

Envelopes and paper cost about 10 to 20 cents per piece.

Printing costs vary. You can print yourself or use a mail house.

Total cost per letter is typically $1 to $2 including everything.

For a campaign of 100 letters, budget $100 to $200. If you get 3 responses and close 1 deal worth $5,000 in fees, that's an excellent return on investment.

---

[SCENE 9 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Direct mail is effective because it's tangible, persistent, and credible. Use personal letters for the best results. Follow a multi-touch campaign over several weeks. Track your results and test different approaches. Combine mail with phone calls for maximum effectiveness.

Your action items: Create your letter template. Design your multi-touch campaign schedule. Calculate your budget for 50 to 100 letters. Set up tracking for responses. Send your first batch this week.

In the next chapter, we'll cover door knocking strategies for when you want to make contact in person.

See you there.
