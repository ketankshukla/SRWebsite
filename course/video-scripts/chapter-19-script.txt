CHAPTER 19: WHAT TO OUTSOURCE VS KEEP IN-HOUSE
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 8-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome to Module 6 of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 19, and we're talking about outsourcing.

The key to scaling this business is knowing what to delegate and what to keep for yourself.

Let's figure that out.

---

[SCENE 2 - THE OUTSOURCING MINDSET]
Here's a simple question to guide your outsourcing decisions: Would you pay someone $100 per hour to do this task?

If the answer is no, outsource it. The task is below your value.

If the answer is yes, consider keeping it. The task is high-value work.

Your time is your most valuable asset. Spend it on activities that generate the most revenue.

---

[SCENE 3 - TASKS TO OUTSOURCE]
Let's look at tasks you should consider outsourcing.

Research tasks include: Finding foreclosure records. Calculating surplus amounts. Initial skip tracing. Data entry into your CRM. Organizing lead lists.

These tasks are important but don't require your expertise. A trained VA can do them at a fraction of your hourly value.

Administrative tasks include: Document preparation. Filing paperwork. Following up with counties. Scheduling. Email management.

Again, important but not the best use of your time.

---

[SCENE 4 - TASKS TO KEEP IN-HOUSE]
Keep these high-value activities for yourself, at least initially.

Closing calls require expertise and trust-building that's hard to delegate.

Complex objection handling needs experience and judgment.

Problem resolution involves client relationships you've built.

Strategic decisions about business direction should stay with you.

Quality control ensures your standards are maintained.

These activities directly impact revenue and client satisfaction.

---

[SCENE 5 - THE OUTSOURCING SPECTRUM]
Think of outsourcing as a spectrum with five levels.

Level 1 is Solo Operator. You do everything. Best for starting out and learning the business.

Level 2 is Administrative Support. You do research, outreach, closing, and claims. You outsource data entry, scheduling, and basic admin.

Level 3 is Research Support. You do outreach, closing, and claims oversight. You outsource research, skip tracing, data entry, and admin.

Level 4 is Outreach Support. You do closing calls, client relationships, and oversight. You outsource research, initial outreach, admin, and claims filing.

Level 5 is Fully Leveraged. You do closing, quality control, and strategy. You outsource everything else.

Progress through these levels as your business grows.

---

[SCENE 6 - COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS]
Let's do the math on outsourcing.

Say your target hourly value is $75 per hour. A research VA costs $8 per hour. If the VA saves you 10 hours per week, that's $750 of your time saved. The VA costs $80 for those 10 hours. Your net benefit is $670 per week.

That's almost $35,000 per year in value created by one VA.

The math almost always favors outsourcing low-value tasks.

---

[SCENE 7 - BEFORE YOU OUTSOURCE]
Before outsourcing any task, do these things.

Master the task yourself first. You can't train someone on something you don't understand.

Document the process. Create step-by-step instructions anyone can follow.

Define quality standards. What does "good" look like?

Create checkpoints. How will you verify the work is done correctly?

Start small. Test with a few tasks before handing over everything.

---

[SCENE 8 - COMMON OUTSOURCING MISTAKES]
Avoid these mistakes.

Outsourcing too soon before you understand the task yourself.

Not providing clear instructions and expecting mind-reading.

Micromanaging instead of trusting your systems.

Hiring the cheapest option without considering quality.

Not having quality control processes in place.

Giving up after one bad hire instead of refining your process.

---

[SCENE 9 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Outsource tasks below your hourly value. Keep high-trust, relationship tasks in-house. Create systems before delegating. Start with research and admin tasks. Progress through outsourcing levels as you grow.

Your action items: List all tasks you do weekly. Calculate your target hourly value. Identify the first task to outsource. Create a standard operating procedure for that task. Research VA options for your first hire.

In the next chapter, we'll cover how to hire virtual assistants.

See you there.
