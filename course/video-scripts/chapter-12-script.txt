CHAPTER 12: TRUST AND CREDIBILITY OBJECTIONS
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 8-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 12, and we're focusing specifically on trust and credibility objections.

These are the most common objections you'll face, and they're the most important to handle well. If someone doesn't trust you, nothing else matters.

Let's dive in.

---

[SCENE 2 - WHY TRUST IS EVERYTHING]
Trust is the foundation of every deal you'll close.

These people have been through foreclosure. They've likely been contacted by scammers. They've been burned by institutions they trusted. They're naturally skeptical of anyone offering them money.

Your job is to prove you're different. You're legitimate, professional, and genuinely there to help.

Building trust isn't about tricks or techniques. It's about being trustworthy and demonstrating that through your words and actions.

---

[SCENE 3 - THIS IS A SCAM OBJECTION]
Let's handle "This is a scam" in depth.

First, don't get defensive. Getting defensive makes you look guilty.

Say: "I completely understand why you'd be cautious. There are unfortunately a lot of scams targeting people who've been through foreclosure. That's actually one reason I do this work, to help people before scammers get to them."

Then offer verification: "Let me give you three ways to verify everything. One, call the county directly and ask about surplus funds for your property. Two, look up my company online and check our reviews. Three, I'll send you documentation you can review on your own. Would that help?"

---

[SCENE 4 - I DON'T TRUST YOU OBJECTION]
When they say "I don't trust you," they're being honest. Respect that.

Say: "I appreciate your honesty. Trust has to be earned, and we just met. I wouldn't expect you to trust me yet."

Then build credibility: "Here's what I can offer. I've helped [X] families recover surplus funds. I'm a registered business in [State]. I have reviews online you can read. And I'm happy to provide references from past clients. What would help you feel more comfortable?"

Don't push. Let them tell you what they need to trust you.

---

[SCENE 5 - HOW DID YOU FIND ME OBJECTION]
"How did you get my information?" is really a trust question.

Be completely transparent: "Great question. Foreclosure sales are public record. I research these records to find people who have surplus funds waiting for them. Your name and former address were in the public foreclosure records, and I used that to find your current contact information."

Add: "I know it can feel invasive to get a call out of the blue. But I wanted to make sure you knew about this money before the deadline to claim it passes."

Transparency builds trust. Mystery destroys it.

---

[SCENE 6 - PROVE IT OBJECTION]
When they say "Prove it," they're actually engaged. This is a good sign.

Say: "Absolutely. I'm happy to prove everything I've told you."

Then offer multiple forms of proof: "I can send you the county's surplus funds list showing your name. I can give you the county's phone number so you can verify directly. I can email you the foreclosure sale records. Which would you prefer?"

Always be ready to back up your claims with documentation.

---

[SCENE 7 - PROACTIVE TRUST BUILDING]
Don't wait for trust objections. Build trust proactively.

In your opening, establish credibility early: "My name is [Name] with [Company]. We specialize in helping former homeowners recover surplus funds. We've helped [X] families recover over [Amount] in the past year."

Offer verification before they ask: "I know this might sound too good to be true, so I'm happy to send you documentation you can verify on your own."

Use social proof: "I recently helped a family in [City] recover $32,000 they didn't know they had. They were skeptical at first too."

Be transparent about your fee: "I charge [X]%, and I only get paid if I successfully recover your money. If I don't recover anything, you owe me nothing."

---

[SCENE 8 - BUILDING LONG-TERM CREDIBILITY]
Beyond individual conversations, build credibility for your business.

Get testimonials from every successful client. Written testimonials, video testimonials, and online reviews all help.

Create a professional website with your company information, process explanation, and client success stories.

Get listed on Google Business Profile so people can find and review you.

Consider professional memberships or certifications if available in your area.

The more credibility signals you have, the easier trust conversations become.

---

[SCENE 9 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Trust is the foundation of every deal. Don't get defensive when trust is questioned. Offer multiple ways to verify your claims. Be proactive about building trust. Invest in long-term credibility for your business.

Your action items: Create a list of verification options you can offer. Collect testimonials from past clients. Set up your Google Business Profile. Prepare your credibility statement for your opening. Practice trust-building responses until natural.

In the next chapter, we'll tackle fee and money objections.

See you there.
