CHAPTER 11: OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 10-12 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome to Module 4 of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 11, and we're diving into objection handling.

Objections are a natural part of the sales process. How you handle them determines whether you close the deal or lose the client.

Let's master this critical skill.

---

[SCENE 2 - THE PSYCHOLOGY OF OBJECTIONS]
First, understand what objections really are.

Objections are not rejections. They're requests for more information or reassurance.

When someone objects, they're actually engaged. They're thinking about your offer. A truly uninterested person just says no and hangs up.

Most objections come from fear. Fear of being scammed, fear of making a mistake, fear of the unknown.

Your job is to address the underlying concern, not just the surface objection.

---

[SCENE 3 - THE LAER FRAMEWORK]
I use a framework called LAER to handle objections. It stands for Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, and Respond.

L is for Listen. Let them fully express their concern without interrupting. Really hear what they're saying.

A is for Acknowledge. Show that you understand their concern. Validate their feelings.

E is for Explore. Ask questions to understand the real issue. Often the stated objection isn't the real concern.

R is for Respond. Once you understand the real concern, address it directly.

Let me show you how this works in practice.

[SCENE 4 - TOP OBJECTIONS OVERVIEW]
Here are the top 10 objections you'll encounter.

Number 1: "This sounds like a scam."
Number 2: "I don't trust you."
Number 3: "Your fee is too high."
Number 4: "I can do this myself."
Number 5: "I need to think about it."
Number 6: "I need to talk to my spouse or family."
Number 7: "I already have someone helping me."
Number 8: "I don't have time for this."
Number 9: "The amount isn't worth the hassle."
Number 10: "I don't want to deal with this anymore."

In this chapter, I'll give you responses to each of these. The next few chapters will go deeper into specific categories.

[SCENE 5 - SCAM OBJECTION]
Let's start with "This sounds like a scam."

Listen and acknowledge: "I completely understand why you'd think that. There are a lot of scams out there, and you're smart to be cautious."

Explore: "What specifically concerns you? Is it that you've never heard of surplus funds, or is it something about how I contacted you?"

Respond: "Let me give you some ways to verify everything I've told you. First, you can call [County Name] directly at [Number] and ask about surplus funds for your property. Second, I can email you documentation showing the funds exist. Third, you can look up my company online and read reviews. Would any of those help?"

---

[SCENE 6 - FEE OBJECTION]
Next, "Your fee is too high."

Listen and acknowledge: "I hear you. Thirty percent does sound like a lot at first."

Explore: "Can I ask what you're comparing it to? Have you looked into what's involved in filing this claim yourself?"

Respond: "Here's how I look at it. Without my help, you'd need to research the process, gather all the documentation, file the claim correctly, and follow up with the county for weeks or months. Most people never complete this process on their own. My fee covers all of that work, and you only pay if I'm successful. Would you rather have 70% of something or 100% of nothing?"

---

[SCENE 7 - DO IT MYSELF OBJECTION]
"I can do this myself."

Listen and acknowledge: "You absolutely can. This is public information, and anyone can file a claim."

Explore: "Have you looked into what's required? Do you know which forms to file and where to submit them?"

Respond: "Here's what I've found. Most people who try to do this themselves either give up because it's confusing, make mistakes that delay or reject their claim, or simply never get around to it. I've done this many times and know exactly what each county requires. But if you'd prefer to try yourself first, I understand. Just know that I'm here if you need help later."

---

[SCENE 8 - THINK ABOUT IT OBJECTION]
"I need to think about it."

Listen and acknowledge: "Of course. This is an important decision, and you should take time to consider it."

Explore: "Can I ask what specifically you want to think about? Is there a concern I haven't addressed?"

Respond: "I want to make sure you have all the information you need. What questions do you still have? And would it be okay if I followed up with you in a few days?"

The key here is to uncover the real objection hiding behind "I need to think about it."

---

[SCENE 9 - SPOUSE OBJECTION]
"I need to talk to my spouse or family."

Listen and acknowledge: "That makes total sense. This is a decision you should make together."

Explore: "What do you think their main concerns will be?"

Respond: "Would it help if I scheduled a call when you're both available? That way I can answer any questions they have directly. When would be a good time?"

Try to get on a call with both decision-makers rather than having your prospect try to explain everything secondhand.

---

[SCENE 10 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Objections are opportunities, not rejections. Use the LAER framework: Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond. Address the underlying concern, not just the surface objection. Stay calm, empathetic, and professional.

Your action items: Memorize the LAER framework. Write out responses to the top 5 objections you expect. Practice these responses until they're natural. Role-play with a friend or colleague. Track which objections you hear most often.

In the next chapter, we'll go deeper into trust and credibility objections.

See you there.
