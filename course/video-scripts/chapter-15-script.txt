CHAPTER 15: COMPETITION AND DIY OBJECTIONS
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 7-8 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 15, the final chapter in our objection handling module.

Today we're covering competition and DIY objections. These come up when someone thinks they have other options.

Let's handle them with confidence.

---

[SCENE 2 - I CAN DO THIS MYSELF]
"I can do this myself" is common. Here's how to handle it.

Acknowledge: "You absolutely can. This is public information, and anyone can file a claim."

Educate: "Here's what's involved. You'll need to identify the correct office to file with, obtain the proper forms, gather supporting documentation, file everything correctly, and follow up until the claim is processed. It typically takes [X] hours of work spread over [Y] weeks."

Offer perspective: "Most people who try to do this themselves either give up partway through, make mistakes that delay their claim, or simply never get around to starting. I've done this many times and know exactly what each county requires."

Leave the door open: "If you'd like to try yourself first, I completely understand. Just know that I'm here if you need help later."

---

[SCENE 3 - WHY SHOULD I PAY YOU]
"Why should I pay you when I can do it for free?"

Reframe: "Great question. You're not paying for information. You're paying for execution and expertise."

Explain value: "Think about taxes. You could do them yourself for free, but many people pay an accountant because they want it done right and don't want to spend hours figuring it out. This is similar."

Add: "My fee covers all the research, paperwork, filing, and follow-up. You sign a few documents, and I handle everything else. For most people, that's worth the fee."

---

[SCENE 4 - SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY CONTACTED ME]
"Someone else already contacted me about this."

Stay calm. This happens.

Ask: "Have you signed anything with them yet?"

If no: "Great. Before you decide, I'd encourage you to compare. Ask them about their success rate, their fee, and how they'll keep you informed. I'm happy to answer those same questions about my service."

If yes: "I understand. If for any reason that doesn't work out, please keep my information. I'm here if you need me."

Never badmouth competitors. It makes you look unprofessional.

---

[SCENE 5 - YOUR COMPETITOR CHARGES LESS]
"I found someone who charges less."

Acknowledge: "There are definitely companies that charge less."

Differentiate: "The question is what you're getting for that fee. Some companies take on hundreds of cases and provide minimal attention. I work with a smaller number of clients and provide personalized service."

Ask: "What's their success rate? How will they communicate with you? Do they have references you can check? Those factors often matter more than a few percentage points in fee."

---

[SCENE 6 - I'LL JUST CALL THE COUNTY]
"I'll just call the county and figure it out."

Encourage it: "That's actually a great idea. I'd recommend calling [County Office] at [Number]. They can confirm the surplus funds exist."

But set expectations: "What they won't do is walk you through the entire claims process, help you gather documentation, or follow up on your behalf. That's where I come in."

Add: "After you verify the funds exist, give me a call if you'd like help with the actual claim."

This shows confidence and positions you as helpful, not pushy.

---

[SCENE 7 - DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES]
Stand out from competitors with these strategies.

Specialize in your area: "I focus specifically on [County/State], so I know exactly how their process works."

Emphasize communication: "I provide weekly updates so you always know the status of your claim."

Highlight success rate: "I have a [X]% success rate on claims I take on."

Offer guarantees: "If I don't recover your funds, you pay nothing."

Provide references: "I'm happy to connect you with past clients who can share their experience."

---

[SCENE 8 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. DIY objections are opportunities to demonstrate value. Never badmouth competitors. Differentiate on service, expertise, and results. Encourage verification while positioning yourself as the expert. Stay confident and professional.

Your action items: Prepare your DIY response with specific process details. Research your competitors and their offerings. Develop your differentiation points. Collect references from past clients. Practice competition objection responses.

Congratulations on completing Module 4! In the next chapter, we move to Module 5 and learn closing techniques.

See you there.
