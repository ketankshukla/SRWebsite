Welcome back. This is Chapter 5, and we're covering skip tracing, which is the art of finding people who have moved or are difficult to locate.

After a foreclosure, homeowners often relocate. Your job is to find them so you can deliver the good news about their surplus funds.

Let's dive in.

Skip tracing is the process of locating a person's current contact information when their previous information is outdated.

The term comes from the phrase "to skip town." You're tracing someone who has "skipped" from their previous address.

For surplus funds recovery, you typically have the former property address and the owner's name. You need to find their current phone number, email, and mailing address.

Let's start with free methods you can use.

Public records searches include voter registration records, property tax records for other properties they may own, court records, and marriage and divorce records.

Social media is incredibly powerful. Search Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other platforms. Look for the person's name combined with their city or former city.

Search engines like Google can reveal a lot. Search their name in quotes, add their city, and look through the results.

Whitepages and similar sites offer free basic searches that sometimes provide current addresses and phone numbers.

And relative contact is another approach. Find relatives through public records, then reach out to them to get a message to your target.

For more reliable results, consider paid skip tracing services.

BatchSkipTracing is popular in real estate. It costs about 10 to 15 cents per record and provides phone numbers, emails, and addresses.

Skip Genie is another option at around 15 to 20 cents per record with good accuracy.

TLO and IRB Search are professional-grade services used by investigators. They're more expensive but very accurate.

BeenVerified and Spokeo are consumer services at about $20 to $30 per month for unlimited searches.

For most people starting out, BatchSkipTracing offers the best balance of cost and quality.

Here's my recommended skip tracing process.

Step 1: Start with what you know. You have the name and former address from foreclosure records.

Step 2: Run a paid skip trace. Upload your list to BatchSkipTracing or similar service.

Step 3: Verify the results. Check that phone numbers are active and addresses are current.

Step 4: Supplement with free methods. Use social media and public records to fill gaps.

Step 5: Find multiple contact points. Get phone, email, and mailing address if possible.

Step 6: Research relatives as backup. If you can't reach the person directly, relatives can help.

Not all skip trace results are equal. Here's how to evaluate them.

Look for confidence scores. Most services provide a confidence percentage. Prioritize results with 70% or higher confidence.

Check for multiple matches. If you get several possible phone numbers, start with the highest confidence one.

Verify phone type. Cell phones are better than landlines for reaching people.

Look for recent activity. An address with recent mail delivery is more likely current.

Cross-reference sources. If multiple sources show the same information, it's more likely accurate.

Follow these best practices for effective skip tracing.

Batch your skip traces. Upload multiple records at once to save time and money.

Keep records of all attempts. Document every phone number tried and every address mailed.

Update your data regularly. People move, so re-skip trace after 60 to 90 days if you haven't made contact.

Respect privacy. Use information only for legitimate business purposes.

Stay compliant. Follow all laws regarding contact attempts and data usage.

Sometimes you won't be able to locate someone. Here's what to do.

Try relative outreach. Contact family members who may be able to pass along your message.

Send mail to last known address. It may forward to their new location.

Check social media regularly. People update their profiles over time.

Set a reminder to retry. Come back to difficult cases in 30 to 60 days.

Know when to move on. If you've exhausted all options, focus on other leads.

Let's recap. Skip tracing is essential for finding relocated homeowners. Start with free methods, then use paid services for better results. Follow a systematic process and verify your results. Document everything and stay compliant.

Your action items: Choose a skip tracing service to try. Practice with your first batch of 10 leads. Develop your verification process. Create a system for tracking contact attempts. Set up social media search templates.

In the next chapter, we'll cover how to qualify your leads so you focus on the best opportunities.

See you there.
