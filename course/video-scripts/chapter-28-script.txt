Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 9-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome to Module 8, the final module of the Surplus Funds Recovery Mastery Course. This is Chapter 28, and we're covering strategic partnerships.

Partnerships can accelerate your growth and create referral streams. Let's build your network.

---

[SCENE 2 - TYPES OF PARTNERS]
There are three types of strategic partners.

Referral Partners are professionals who encounter your target clients. They include real estate attorneys, bankruptcy attorneys, real estate agents, title companies, mortgage brokers, and credit counselors.

Service Partners are businesses that complement your services. They include skip tracing companies, data providers, call centers, and marketing agencies.

Industry Partners are others in the surplus funds space. They include recovery specialists in different markets, attorneys who handle surplus claims, and heir search companies.

Each type of partner offers different benefits.

---

[SCENE 3 - THE PARTNERSHIP PITCH]
Here's how to pitch a potential partner.

"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with [Company]. I specialize in helping former homeowners recover surplus funds from foreclosure sales.

I'm reaching out because I imagine you occasionally have clients who've been through foreclosure. Many don't realize they may have money waiting for them.

I'd love to be a resource for your clients. I also offer a referral fee for any clients you send my way.

Would you be open to a brief meeting to discuss?"

Keep it simple. Focus on how you can help their clients.

---

[SCENE 4 - REFERRAL FEE STRUCTURES]
There are several ways to structure referral fees.

Flat fee: $200 to $500 per signed client.

Percentage: 5 to 15% of your fee collected.

Tiered: Higher percentages for higher volume.

Choose the structure that makes sense for the relationship and the value they provide.

Always put referral agreements in writing.

---

[SCENE 5 - ATTORNEY PARTNERSHIPS]
Attorneys are particularly valuable partners.

They provide credibility by association. Clients trust you more when referred by their attorney.

They have access to clients who need your services.

They offer legal expertise when you encounter complex cases.

They can handle cases that require attorney involvement.

Types of arrangements include: Referral where the attorney refers and you pay a fee. Co-counsel where the attorney is involved and you split fees. Of counsel where you work under attorney supervision.

---

[SCENE 6 - BUILDING YOUR NETWORK]
Build your referral network in phases.

Phase 1, months 1 through 3: Identify 10 to 20 potential partners. Reach out to all of them. Secure 3 to 5 initial partnerships.

Phase 2, months 4 through 6: Expand to 10 to 15 active partners. Formalize agreements. Track referral sources.

Phase 3, months 7 through 12: Build to 20 or more active partners. Implement systematic nurturing. Consider partner appreciation events.

Relationships take time. Be patient and consistent.

---

[SCENE 7 - PARTNERSHIP BEST PRACTICES]
Follow these best practices.

Do put agreements in writing. Communicate regularly. Pay promptly when referrals close. Deliver on your promises. Keep partners informed about their referrals.

Don't overpromise results. Don't neglect relationships after they're established. Don't compete with your partners. Don't share confidential information.

Treat partners as valued relationships, not just lead sources.

---

[SCENE 8 - MEASURING PARTNERSHIP ROI]
Track the return on your partnership efforts.

For each partner, track: Number of referrals received. Conversion rate of those referrals. Revenue generated. Referral fees paid. Net profit from the relationship.

Calculate ROI: Revenue minus referral fees, divided by time invested.

Double down on high-performing partnerships. Evaluate or exit low-performing ones.

---

[SCENE 9 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Strategic partnerships accelerate growth. Referral partners provide warm leads. Attorneys add credibility and expertise. Build a network, not just individual relationships. Track ROI and optimize your partnerships.

Your action items: List 20 potential referral partners. Create your partnership pitch. Develop a referral agreement template. Reach out to 5 partners this week. Set up partnership tracking.

In the next chapter, we'll cover marketing and brand building.

See you there.
