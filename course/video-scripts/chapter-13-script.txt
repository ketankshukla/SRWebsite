Welcome back. This is Chapter 13, and we're tackling fee and money objections.

"Your fee is too high" is one of the most common objections you'll hear. Let's learn how to handle it with confidence.

First, understand why people object to fees.

Sticker shock is common. Thirty percent sounds like a lot when you first hear it.

They don't understand the value yet. They don't know how much work is involved.

They think it's easy. They assume they could do it themselves quickly.

They're comparing to nothing. They didn't know this money existed, so any fee feels like losing money.

Your job is to reframe the conversation around value, not cost.

Let's handle "Your fee is too high" in detail.

Acknowledge: "I understand. Thirty percent does sound significant at first."

Reframe: "Let me ask you this. Before I called, did you know this money existed?"

They'll usually say no.

Continue: "So right now, you have zero dollars. If I'm successful, you'll have [70% amount]. The question isn't whether 30% is too much. It's whether [70% amount] is worth having."

Add the risk reversal: "And remember, if I don't recover anything, you pay nothing. I take all the risk."

Help them understand the value equation.

Your fee covers: Research to find and verify the funds. Skip tracing to locate them. Outreach to make contact. Documentation gathering. Claim preparation and filing. Follow-up with the county. Problem resolution if issues arise.

Ask: "If you had to do all of this yourself, how many hours would it take? And what's your time worth?"

Most people realize the value when they understand the work involved.

When they ask "Can you lower your fee?"

Option 1, hold firm: "I understand you'd like a lower fee. Unfortunately, [X]% is my standard rate. It reflects the work involved and the risk I take. I only get paid if I'm successful."

Option 2, negotiate strategically: "I typically charge [X]%, but for larger amounts like yours, I can offer [slightly lower]%. Would that work for you?"

Only negotiate if it makes business sense. Don't undervalue your service.

When they say "I'll find someone cheaper."

Say: "You might find someone who charges less. But I'd encourage you to ask them a few questions. How many claims have they successfully filed? What's their success rate? Will they provide references?"

Add: "In this business, you often get what you pay for. A cheaper service that fails to recover your funds costs you everything. I have a [X]% success rate and references from satisfied clients."

When the surplus is smaller and they say "It's not worth the hassle."

Acknowledge: "I understand. [Amount] might not seem life-changing."

Reframe: "But think about it this way. This is money that's already yours. You're not doing anything to earn it. All you need to do is sign some paperwork, and I handle everything else. In [timeframe], you'll have [their portion] deposited in your account. Is there something you could use that money for?"

Connect it to something tangible: a bill they could pay off, a small vacation, an emergency fund.

Address the risk concern directly.

Say: "That's a fair question. If I don't recover anything, you owe me nothing. Zero. I take all the risk."

Explain why: "I only take cases I believe I can win. I've done my research, and I'm confident in your claim. But if something unexpected happens and the claim fails, you're not out anything."

This removes the risk objection entirely.

Let's recap. Fee objections are really about perceived value. Reframe from cost to value. Explain what your fee covers. Use the risk reversal, they pay nothing if you fail. Don't undervalue your service by negotiating too quickly.

Your action items: Calculate the value of your service in hours and expertise. Prepare your value explanation. Decide your negotiation boundaries. Practice fee objection responses. Create a one-page value summary to send prospects.

In the next chapter, we'll handle timing and process objections.

See you there.
