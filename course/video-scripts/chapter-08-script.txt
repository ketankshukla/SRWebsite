CHAPTER 8: COLD CALLING SCRIPTS
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 10-12 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 8, and we're getting into the practical side of outreach: cold calling scripts.

By the end of this video, you'll have word-for-word scripts you can use to contact homeowners and start conversations that lead to signed clients.

Let's get into it.

---

[SCENE 2 - BEFORE YOU CALL]
Before you pick up the phone, prepare yourself.

Have all the information ready: the person's name, the property address, the approximate surplus amount, and the foreclosure date.

Set your mindset. Remember, you're delivering good news. You're not selling anything. You're informing them about money that belongs to them.

Be ready for any reaction. They might be excited, skeptical, angry, or confused. All of these are normal.

Have your CRM or notes open so you can document the call immediately.

---

[SCENE 3 - THE OPENING]
Your opening sets the tone for the entire call. Here's a direct approach that works well.

"Hi, is this [First Name]? Great. My name is [Your Name], and I'm calling with some good news about a property you used to own at [Address]. Do you have a quick minute?"

If they say yes, continue. If they say no, ask when would be a better time to call back.

Here's a softer alternative opening.

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm reaching out because I found some information about your former property at [Address] that I think you'll want to know about. Is this a good time?"

Both openings are honest, direct, and create curiosity without being pushy.

---

[SCENE 4 - THE CORE MESSAGE]
Once you have their attention, deliver your core message clearly.

"After your property was sold at foreclosure, there was money left over. This is called surplus funds, and it legally belongs to you. Based on my research, there's approximately [Amount] waiting to be claimed."

Pause and let that sink in. They'll likely have questions or reactions.

If they're skeptical, say: "I completely understand your skepticism. This does sound too good to be true. But I can send you documentation that proves the funds exist. Would you like me to email or mail that to you?"

If they're interested, say: "Great. Let me explain how this works and how I can help you recover this money."

---

[SCENE 5 - EXPLAINING YOUR SERVICE]
When they want to know more, explain your service simply.

"Here's how it works. I specialize in helping people recover surplus funds from foreclosure sales. I handle all the paperwork, deal with the county, and make sure you get your money."

"My fee is [X]%, and I only get paid if I successfully recover your funds. If I don't recover anything, you owe me nothing."

"The process typically takes [timeframe], and I keep you updated every step of the way."

Keep it simple. Don't overwhelm them with details unless they ask.

---

[SCENE 6 - HANDLING INITIAL RESPONSES]
Let's cover how to handle common initial responses.

If they say "This sounds like a scam," respond with: "I completely understand why you'd think that. There are a lot of scams out there. That's why I'm happy to send you documentation you can verify yourself. I can also give you the county's phone number so you can confirm the funds exist. Would that help?"

If they say "I need to think about it," respond with: "Absolutely, take your time. Can I send you some information to review? And would it be okay if I followed up in a few days?"

If they say "How did you get my number," respond with: "I found your information through public records research. Foreclosure sales are public record, and I specialize in finding people who have unclaimed funds."

If they say "I'm not interested," respond with: "I understand. Just so you know, this money does belong to you, and there may be a deadline to claim it. If you change your mind, you can reach me at [number]. Have a great day."

---

[SCENE 7 - VOICEMAIL SCRIPT]
Many calls will go to voicemail. Here's an effective voicemail script.

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] calling with some important information about your former property at [Address]. I've found that there may be money owed to you from the foreclosure sale. Please give me a call back at [Your Number]. Again, that's [Your Number]. I look forward to speaking with you."

Keep voicemails short, intriguing, and include your callback number twice.

---

[SCENE 8 - FOLLOW-UP CALLS]
Most people won't answer or respond on the first attempt. Here's a follow-up script.

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] again. I left you a message last week about surplus funds from your former property at [Address]. I wanted to make sure you received that information. There's approximately [Amount] that belongs to you, and I'd love to help you recover it. Please call me back at [Number] when you have a chance."

Plan for 5 to 7 contact attempts over 2 to 3 weeks before moving a lead to lower priority.

---

[SCENE 9 - CALL METRICS]
Track these metrics to improve your calling.

Calls per hour: Aim for 15 to 25 dials per hour.

Contact rate: The percentage of calls where you reach a live person. Target 20 to 30%.

Conversation rate: The percentage of contacts that turn into real conversations. Target 50% or higher.

Appointment or sign rate: The percentage of conversations that lead to next steps. Target 20 to 30%.

Track these numbers weekly and look for ways to improve.

---

[SCENE 10 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Prepare before every call with all relevant information. Use a clear, honest opening that creates curiosity. Deliver your core message simply and pause for their reaction. Handle objections with empathy and offer verification. Leave effective voicemails and follow up persistently. Track your metrics and improve over time.

Your action items: Write out your personalized opening script. Practice your core message until it's natural. Prepare responses for the top 5 objections. Set up your call tracking system. Make your first 20 calls this week.

In the next chapter, we'll cover direct mail campaigns as another powerful outreach method.

See you there.
