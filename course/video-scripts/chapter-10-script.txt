CHAPTER 10: DOOR KNOCKING STRATEGIES
Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 7-8 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 10, and we're covering door knocking strategies.

Door knocking is the most direct form of outreach. It's not for everyone, but when done right, it can be incredibly effective.

Let's explore when and how to use this approach.

---

[SCENE 2 - WHEN TO DOOR KNOCK]
Door knocking makes sense in specific situations.

When you can't reach them otherwise. If phone and mail haven't worked, a personal visit might.

When the surplus is large. For amounts over $25,000, the extra effort is justified.

When they're local. Only door knock if the person lives within a reasonable driving distance.

When you have a verified current address. Don't waste time on outdated addresses.

When you're comfortable with face-to-face interaction. This approach requires confidence and people skills.

---

[SCENE 3 - PREPARATION]
Before you knock, prepare thoroughly.

Know all the details. Property address, surplus amount, foreclosure date, and any other relevant information.

Bring documentation. Have printed proof of the surplus funds to leave with them.

Dress professionally. Business casual is appropriate. You want to look trustworthy, not intimidating.

Bring business cards. Always leave your contact information.

Plan your route. If you have multiple visits in an area, plan efficiently.

Have your script ready. Know exactly what you're going to say.

---

[SCENE 4 - THE DOOR KNOCK SCRIPT]
Here's a script for when they answer the door.

"Hi, are you [First Name]? My name is [Your Name], and I apologize for showing up unannounced. I tried calling and sending letters, but I have some important information about money that belongs to you, and I wanted to make sure you received it."

Pause and gauge their reaction.

If they're receptive, continue: "After your former property at [Address] was sold, there was approximately [Amount] left over. This money legally belongs to you, and I specialize in helping people recover it. Do you have a few minutes to talk?"

If they're hesitant: "I completely understand if this is a bad time. I have some documentation here that explains everything. Can I leave this with you, and you can call me if you're interested?"

---

[SCENE 5 - HANDLING REACTIONS]
Be prepared for various reactions.

If they're interested, great. Explain your service, answer questions, and try to set an appointment or get them to sign.

If they're skeptical, don't push. Leave your documentation and business card. Say, "I understand. Please review this information, and feel free to call the county to verify. My number is on the card if you have questions."

If they're hostile, stay calm and leave. Say, "I apologize for bothering you. Have a good day." Walk away. Never argue.

If they're not home, leave a door hanger or note with your information and a brief message.

---

[SCENE 6 - SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS]
Safety is paramount when door knocking.

Go during daylight hours. Never knock on doors after dark.

Let someone know your route. Share your schedule with a friend or family member.

Trust your instincts. If something feels off, leave immediately.

Stay aware of your surroundings. Park in visible areas and keep your phone accessible.

Don't enter homes. Conduct all conversations at the door or invite them to meet at a public place.

Be respectful of no soliciting signs. Some areas have ordinances against door-to-door contact.

---

[SCENE 7 - DOOR HANGERS AND LEAVE-BEHINDS]
When no one's home, leave something behind.

Door hangers work well. Include a headline like "Important Information About Money Owed to You" and your contact details.

A letter in an envelope works too. Write "Important - Time Sensitive" on the outside.

Include key information: the property address, approximate surplus amount, your name and contact info, and a call to action.

Make it look professional, not like junk mail.

---

[SCENE 8 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. Door knocking is best for high-value leads you can't reach otherwise. Prepare thoroughly with documentation and a clear script. Handle all reactions professionally and calmly. Prioritize your safety at all times. Leave information behind when no one's home.

Your action items: Decide if door knocking fits your business model. Create your door knock script. Design a door hanger or leave-behind piece. Identify 5 high-value local leads to visit. Plan your first door knocking route.

In the next chapter, we move to Module 4 and dive deep into objection handling.

See you there.
