[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 29, and we're covering marketing and brand building.

A strong brand generates inbound leads and builds trust before you ever speak to a prospect. Let's build yours.

[SCENE 2 - BRAND FOUNDATION]
Your brand starts with your foundation.

Your mission: Why does your company exist?

Your values: What do you stand for?

Your unique value proposition: Why should someone choose you?

Your voice: How do you communicate?

Write these down. They guide every marketing decision.

---

[SCENE 3 - VISUAL IDENTITY]
Your visual identity includes four elements.

Your logo: Creates recognition. Keep it simple and professional.

Your colors: Create consistency. Choose colors that convey trust. Blues and greens work well for financial services.

Your fonts: Convey professionalism. Use clean, readable fonts.

Your imagery: Creates emotional connection. Use images that resonate with your audience.

Apply these consistently across all materials.

[SCENE 4 - YOUR ONLINE PRESENCE]
Your website is your digital home base. It must include:

A home page with a clear value proposition and call to action.

An about page with your story, credentials, and team.

A services page explaining what you do and how it works.

An FAQ page answering common questions.

A contact page with multiple ways to reach you.

Testimonials providing social proof.

Make sure your website looks professional and works on mobile devices.

---

[SCENE 5 - GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE]
Set up your Google Business Profile. It's free and powerful.

It appears in local searches when people look for surplus funds help.

It shows your reviews and builds credibility.

It provides your contact information and hours.

It's often the first impression people have of your business.

Claim your profile, complete all information, and actively collect reviews.

---

[SCENE 6 - CONTENT MARKETING]
Content marketing establishes your expertise.

Blog post ideas: "What Are Surplus Funds?" "How to Know If You Have Surplus Funds." "The Surplus Funds Claims Process Explained." "Common Mistakes When Claiming Surplus Funds."

Video content: Explainer videos. Process walkthroughs. Client testimonials. FAQ answers.

Create content that answers the questions your prospects are asking.

---

[SCENE 7 - REPUTATION MANAGEMENT]
Your reputation is your most valuable asset.

Build reviews by asking after successful claims, when clients express satisfaction, and at natural relationship milestones.

Handle negative reviews by responding promptly within 24 hours, thanking them for feedback, apologizing for their experience, taking the conversation offline, and addressing the issue.

Monitor your online presence regularly. Know what people are saying about you.
