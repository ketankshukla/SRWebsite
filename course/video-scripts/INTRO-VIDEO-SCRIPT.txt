[SCENE 1 - WELCOME AND HOOK (0:00-1:30)]

Hello, and welcome.

If you're watching this video, chances are you've been through something incredibly difficult. Losing a home to foreclosure is one of the most stressful experiences anyone can face. The uncertainty, the paperwork, the emotional toll — it's overwhelming.

But here's something most people don't know. Something that could change everything for you.

When your home was sold at that foreclosure auction, it may have sold for more than what you owed. And if it did, that extra money — that surplus — legally belongs to you.

Not the bank. Not the county. You.

I'm here to explain exactly what surplus funds are, how to find out if you have money waiting for you, and how we can help you recover it — with absolutely no upfront cost to you.

So please, stay with me for the next 30 minutes. What you learn could put thousands of dollars back in your pocket.

---

[SCENE 2 - WHAT ARE SURPLUS FUNDS (1:30-5:00)]

Let's start with the basics. What exactly are surplus funds?

When a home goes through foreclosure, it's eventually sold at a public auction. The purpose of this auction is to recover the money owed to the lender — the mortgage balance, plus any fees, penalties, and costs associated with the foreclosure process.

But here's what happens sometimes. The property sells for more than what was owed.

Let me give you a real example.

Imagine a home sells at auction for $285,000. The outstanding mortgage balance was $200,000. There were $40,000 in back taxes and fees. And $20,000 in legal and foreclosure costs. That's a total of $260,000 owed.

$285,000 minus $260,000 equals $25,000.

That $25,000 is called surplus funds. You might also hear it called "excess proceeds" or "overage." Different terms, same thing.

And here's the critical point: that $25,000 legally belongs to the former homeowner. That's you.

The lender doesn't get to keep it. The county doesn't get to keep it. By law, it belongs to the person who owned the property before the foreclosure.

This isn't some loophole or obscure technicality. In 2023, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in a case called Tyler versus Hennepin County that homeowners are absolutely entitled to surplus funds from foreclosure sales. The court said that government retention of these funds is unconstitutional.

So if you had surplus funds from your foreclosure, you have a legal right to that money. Period.

---

[SCENE 3 - WHY FUNDS GO UNCLAIMED (5:00-8:30)]

Now you might be wondering: if this money belongs to me, why didn't anyone tell me about it?

That's a great question. And the answer reveals a frustrating reality about how the system works.

First, let's talk about notification. After a foreclosure sale, the trustee or court is supposed to send a "Notice of Surplus Funds" to the former homeowner. Sounds reasonable, right?

Here's the problem. They send that notice to your last known address. And what's your last known address? The property that was just foreclosed on. The home you no longer live in.

So the notice goes to an empty house, or to whoever bought the property at auction. It never reaches you.

Second, many people simply don't know surplus funds exist. When you're going through foreclosure, you're focused on finding a new place to live, dealing with the emotional stress, and trying to move forward. Nobody sits you down and explains that you might have money coming to you.

Third, banks and lenders have no incentive to tell you. Think about it. They got their money from the auction. The surplus isn't their concern. They're not going to call you up and say, "Hey, there's $25,000 waiting for you."

Fourth, the process to claim surplus funds is complicated. Each state has different rules. Each county has different procedures. There are forms to fill out, documents to gather, deadlines to meet. Most people don't even know where to start.

And fifth, there are strict deadlines. Some states give you as little as 60 days to file a claim. Others give you a few years. But if you miss the deadline, that money can be forfeited forever. It goes to the state through a process called escheatment.

The result of all this? Billions of dollars in surplus funds go unclaimed every single year across the United States. Billions. With a B.

Your money could be sitting in a county account right now, waiting for you to claim it. And if you don't act, you could lose it forever.

---

[SCENE 4 - HOW TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE FUNDS (8:30-11:30)]

So how do you find out if you have surplus funds waiting?

There are a few ways to check.

Option one: Contact the foreclosure trustee. Their information should appear on the Notice of Trustee Sale that was posted on your property before the auction. They can tell you if there were surplus funds from your sale.

Option two: Check with the county clerk of court. Surplus funds are typically deposited with the court or county treasurer. You can contact them directly and ask if there are funds in your name.

Option three: Search state unclaimed property databases. Websites like MissingMoney.com aggregate unclaimed property records from multiple states. Your surplus funds might show up there.

Option four: Contact us for a free consultation. This is the easiest option. We'll research public records on your behalf and determine if surplus funds exist from your foreclosure. There's no cost for this research, and no obligation.

Here's what we need to get started: your name, the address of the foreclosed property, and the approximate date of the foreclosure. With that information, we can usually determine within a few days whether you have funds waiting.

If you do have surplus funds, we'll tell you exactly how much. If you don't, we'll let you know that too. Either way, you'll have clarity.

---

[SCENE 5 - THE CLAIMS PROCESS EXPLAINED (11:30-15:00)]

Let's say you do have surplus funds. What happens next? How do you actually get that money?

This is where things get complicated — and where most people get stuck.

The claims process varies by state and county, but here's a general overview of what's involved.

Step one: Identify where your funds are held. Depending on your state and the type of foreclosure, surplus funds might be held by the court, the county treasurer, the state comptroller, or another government office. File with the wrong one, and you have to start over.

Step two: Gather documentation. You'll need to prove you're the rightful owner of those funds. This typically includes a copy of the deed showing you owned the property, government-issued ID, proof of your current address, and sometimes additional documents like death certificates if you're an heir, probate documents if the property was part of an estate, or affidavits and notarized statements.

Step three: Complete the required forms. Each jurisdiction has its own forms. Some are straightforward. Others are complex legal documents that require precise language. One mistake can result in your claim being denied.

Step four: Submit your claim before the deadline. Remember those strict deadlines I mentioned? Miss them, and you lose your money. Florida gives you 60 to 120 days. Texas gives you 2 years. California gives you 1 year. Georgia gives you 5 years. Other states fall somewhere in between.

Step five: Wait for processing. After you submit your claim, the court or county reviews it. This can take anywhere from 30 days to several months, depending on the jurisdiction and complexity of your case.

Step six: Handle any complications. Sometimes there are competing claims from junior lienholders, other heirs, or even scammers. Sometimes your claim is denied for technical reasons. Sometimes you need to appear at a court hearing. Each complication adds time and complexity.

Step seven: Receive your funds. If everything goes smoothly, you eventually receive a check for your surplus funds.

That's the process in a nutshell. And if you're thinking it sounds complicated, time-consuming, and stressful — you're absolutely right.

[SCENE 6 - DIY VS PROFESSIONAL HELP - INTRODUCTION (15:00-16:30)]

At this point, you might be asking yourself: Can I just do this myself?

The honest answer is yes, you can try. The claims process is technically open to anyone. You don't need a lawyer or a professional to file a claim.

But here's what I want you to understand. Just because you can do something yourself doesn't mean you should.

Let me give you an analogy. You can technically represent yourself in court. You can technically do your own taxes. You can technically fix your own car. But most people choose to hire professionals for these things because the professionals know what they're doing, they do it faster, and they get better results.

Surplus fund recovery is the same way.

Over the next few minutes, I'm going to walk you through exactly what's involved in doing this yourself versus working with us. I want you to have all the information so you can make the best decision for your situation.

---

[SCENE 7 - THE DIY CHALLENGES (16:30-21:00)]

Let's talk about what you're really signing up for if you try to recover surplus funds on your own.

Challenge number one: Research which office holds your funds.

As I mentioned, surplus funds can be held by different offices depending on your state, county, and type of foreclosure. Was it a mortgage foreclosure or a tax sale? Was it judicial or non-judicial? Each scenario has different rules. File with the wrong office, and you have to start over from scratch.

Challenge number two: Navigate complex legal procedures.

Each jurisdiction has different forms, different requirements, and different deadlines. The forms often use legal terminology that's confusing if you're not familiar with it. Terms like "escheatment," "interpleader," and "priority of liens." One wrong answer or missing piece of information can result in your claim being denied.

Challenge number three: Gather extensive documentation.

You'll need deeds, death certificates if applicable, probate documents if the property was part of an estate, ID verification, proof of address, and more. And you need to know exactly what format each office requires. Some want original documents. Some want certified copies. Some want notarized affidavits.

Challenge number four: Make countless phone calls.

Government offices are not known for quick responses. Expect to be transferred multiple times. Expect to be put on hold. Expect to be told to call back. Expect voicemails that never get returned. This process can take weeks or months of persistent follow-up.

Challenge number five: Risk missing strict deadlines.

I can't emphasize this enough. Some states give you as little as 60 days to file a claim. If you're still trying to figure out the process when that deadline passes, your money is gone forever. There are no extensions. There are no exceptions.

Challenge number six: Handle competing claims.

Sometimes other parties file claims on the same funds. Junior lienholders, other heirs, or even scammers who target foreclosure victims. Do you know how to protect your rights against competing claims? Do you know how to prove your claim has priority?

Challenge number seven: Wait months with no updates.

After you submit your claim, you wait. And wait. And wonder. Is my claim being processed? Was it lost? Was it denied? Did I do something wrong? The uncertainty is stressful, and getting updates from government offices is often difficult.

Challenge number eight: Pay for certified copies and notarization.

Document fees, certified copies, notary fees — these costs add up. And here's the thing: you pay these costs whether you succeed or not. If your claim is denied, you're out that money with nothing to show for it.

Challenge number nine: Take time off work.

Government offices are open 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. Court hearings happen during business hours. If you have a job, you'll need to take time off to make phone calls, visit offices, and attend hearings. Can you afford that time away from work?

Challenge number ten: Handle denials and appeals.

If your claim is denied — and many are denied on the first attempt due to technical errors — do you know how to appeal? Most people don't. They get a denial letter, feel defeated, and give up. And they lose their money.

Challenge number eleven: Risk getting scammed.

Unfortunately, foreclosure victims are often targeted by scammers. You might receive official-looking letters offering to help you claim funds — for an upfront fee. Without experience, how do you know what's legitimate and what's a scam?

Challenge number twelve: Deal with all of this while recovering from foreclosure.

Let's be honest. You've already been through a traumatic experience. Losing your home is stressful enough. Do you really want to add weeks or months of bureaucratic frustration on top of that?

Most people who try the DIY approach give up after a few weeks of frustration. Or worse, they miss their deadline entirely and lose everything.
