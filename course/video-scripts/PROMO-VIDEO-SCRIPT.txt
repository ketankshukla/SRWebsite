SURPLUS FUNDS RECOVERY BUSINESS MASTERY COURSE
Promotional Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: 2 minutes 45 seconds
================================================

[SCENE 1 - HOOK (0:00-0:20)]

What if I told you there's a business where you help people recover money they don't even know they have... and you get paid handsomely for it?

I'm talking about surplus funds recovery. A legitimate, ethical business that generates five and six-figure incomes for people just like you.

And today, I'm going to show you exactly how to build one.

[SCENE 2 - THE OPPORTUNITY (0:20-0:50)]

Here's what most people don't know.

When a property sells at a foreclosure auction for more than what's owed, the extra money belongs to the former homeowner. This is called surplus funds.

The problem? Most people have no idea this money exists. They assume they lost everything.

The result? Billions of dollars sit unclaimed every single year.

That's where you come in.

As a surplus funds recovery specialist, you find these people, help them claim their money, and earn 25 to 35 percent of what you recover.

No upfront costs to your clients. No inventory. No complicated licensing in most states. Just you, helping people get what's rightfully theirs.
