Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 9-10 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 20, and we're covering how to hire virtual assistants.

Finding the right VA can transform your business. Let's learn how to do it right.

---

[SCENE 2 - WHERE TO FIND VAs]
There are two main sources for virtual assistants: freelance platforms and VA agencies.

Freelance platforms include Upwork, which has experienced VAs at $5 to $25 per hour. OnlineJobs.ph specializes in Filipino VAs at $400 to $800 per month full-time. Fiverr is good for project-based work. And Freelancer offers competitive bidding.

VA agencies include Belay for US-based premium VAs at $25 to $50 per hour. Time Etc for executive support at $20 to $35 per hour. And MyOutDesk for real estate VAs at $10 to $15 per hour.

For most surplus funds businesses, I recommend starting with OnlineJobs.ph or Upwork.

[SCENE 3 - DEFINING THE ROLE]
Before you post a job, define the role clearly.

What specific tasks will they perform? List every task in detail.

How many hours do you need? Part-time or full-time?

What schedule is required? Do they need to work specific hours?

What skills are required? Research ability, English proficiency, attention to detail?

What tools will they use? Your CRM, skip tracing services, communication tools?

The clearer you are, the better candidates you'll attract.

[SCENE 4 - CREATING THE JOB POSTING]
Here's a template for your job posting.

Title: Virtual Assistant for Surplus Funds Research

Opening: We're looking for a detail-oriented VA to help with research and data management.

Responsibilities: Research foreclosure records. Perform skip tracing. Enter data into CRM. Prepare lead lists.

Requirements: Excellent written English. Strong attention to detail. Reliable internet connection. Available 20 hours per week.

Compensation: State your range based on experience.

Include a specific instruction in your posting, like "Start your application with the word SURPLUS." This helps you filter out people who don't read carefully.

[SCENE 5 - SCREENING APPLICATIONS]
When reviewing applications, look for green flags and red flags.

Green flags include: Personalized response that references your specific job. Answered all your questions. Clear, professional communication. Relevant experience.

Red flags include: Generic copy-paste responses. Poor English or grammar. Didn't follow your instructions. Vague or incomplete answers.

Filter ruthlessly. You'll get many applications, but only a few will be worth interviewing.

---

[SCENE 6 - THE INTERVIEW]
Interview your top 3 to 5 candidates.

Questions to ask: "Tell me about your previous VA experience." "How do you stay organized with multiple tasks?" "What do you do when you're stuck on a task?" "What's your internet speed and backup plan if it goes down?" "Why are you interested in this role?"

Evaluate: Communication clarity. Problem-solving ability. Reliability indicators. Cultural fit.

Trust your instincts. If something feels off, move on.

---

[SCENE 7 - THE TEST PROJECT]
Before hiring, give a small paid test project.

Pay for 1 to 3 hours of work on a real task.

Evaluate: Quality of work. Communication during the project. Ability to follow instructions. Timeliness.

This is the best predictor of future performance. Don't skip it.

Here are typical rates for different roles.

General VA: $4 to $8 per hour offshore, $15 to $25 per hour US-based.
