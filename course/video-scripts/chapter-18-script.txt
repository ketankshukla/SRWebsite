Video Script for HeyGen
Duration: Approximately 10-12 minutes
================================================

[SCENE 1 - INTRO]
Welcome back. This is Chapter 18, and we're walking through the complete claims process from start to finish.

This is where you deliver on your promise to clients. Let's make sure you do it right.

---

[SCENE 2 - PROCESS OVERVIEW]
The claims process has five distinct phases.

Phase 1 is Document Gathering, which takes 1 to 2 weeks.

Phase 2 is Claim Preparation, which takes 1 to 3 days.

Phase 3 is Filing, which takes 1 day.

Phase 4 is Processing, which takes 30 to 90 days depending on the county.

Phase 5 is Approval and Disbursement, which takes 1 to 4 weeks.

Total timeline is typically 2 to 4 months from signing to payment.

Let's go through each phase.

---

[SCENE 3 - DOCUMENT GATHERING]
Phase 1 is Document Gathering. You need documents from three sources.

From your client, you need: Government-issued photo ID like a driver's license or passport. Social Security card or number. Proof of former address such as a utility bill. And signed authorization forms.

From public records, you need: The deed showing former ownership. Foreclosure sale confirmation. Surplus funds verification. And any court orders.

From the county, you need: Claim forms. Surplus funds statement. And filing instructions.

Create a checklist and track what you've received and what's still needed.

---

[SCENE 4 - CLAIM PREPARATION]
Phase 2 is Claim Preparation. Here's your checklist.

Completed claim form with all fields filled accurately.

Copy of client's ID, clear and legible.

Proof of ownership or identity.

Authorization to act on their behalf.

Supporting documentation as required.

Cover letter if required by the county.

Notarization if required.

Review everything twice before filing. Mistakes cause delays.

---

[SCENE 5 - FILING]
Phase 3 is Filing. You have several options.

In-person filing gives you immediate confirmation but is time-consuming.

Certified mail provides proof of delivery but is slower.

Online portals are fast and convenient but not always available.

Email is quick but may not be accepted by all counties.

Whichever method you use, always get confirmation of receipt and keep copies of everything you submit.

---

[SCENE 6 - PROCESSING]
Phase 4 is Processing. Here's what happens at the county.

The county receives and logs your claim.

Staff reviews for completeness.

They verify the claimant's identity.

They check for competing claims.

Legal review occurs if required.

Then they either approve the claim or request more information.

This phase is largely out of your control, but you can influence it through follow-up.

---

[SCENE 7 - FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE]
Follow up regularly during processing.

Week 2: Confirm receipt of your claim.

Week 4: Check on status and ask if anything is needed.

Week 6: Follow up if you haven't received an update.

Week 8 and beyond: Weekly check-ins until resolved.

Build relationships with county staff. Be polite and professional. They process many claims and will remember people who are pleasant to work with.

---

[SCENE 8 - APPROVAL AND DISBURSEMENT]
Phase 5 is Approval and Disbursement.

When you receive approval notification, confirm the disbursement method and amount.

Notify your client immediately with the good news.

Track the check or wire status.

Once the client receives funds, collect your fee.

Disbursement methods vary: Check mailed to client is most common. Check mailed to you if assignment is allowed. Wire transfer for large amounts. Or court-ordered distribution for complex cases.

---

[SCENE 9 - HANDLING COMPLICATIONS]
Be prepared for complications.

Missing documents: Request from client promptly and follow up.

Competing claims: May need legal resolution. Consult an attorney.

Deceased owner: Heir documentation and possibly probate required.

Name discrepancies: Provide supporting documents like marriage certificates.

Delays: Escalate by asking to speak with a supervisor.

Document every issue and how you resolved it.

---

[SCENE 10 - SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS]
Let's recap. The claims process has 5 phases: gathering, preparation, filing, processing, and disbursement. Thorough document gathering prevents delays. Always confirm receipt of filings. Follow up regularly during processing. Be prepared to handle complications.

Your action items: Create a document checklist for each county you work. Set up a claims tracking system. Establish a follow-up schedule. Build relationships with county contacts. Document your process for consistency.

Congratulations on completing Module 5! In the next chapter, we start Module 6 on outsourcing and scaling.

See you there.
