## The Mindset Shift

### From "Salesperson" to "Helper"

**Wrong mindset**: "I need to convince them to sign so I can make money."

**Right mindset**: "I have information that could change their life. My job is to help them understand and decide."

### Key Mental Frameworks

#### 1. You're Delivering Good News

You're not asking for anything—you're telling someone they have money waiting for them.

#### 2. Your Fee is Earned

Without you, most of these people would never see this money. Your fee is for a valuable service.

#### 3. Rejection Isn't Personal

Some people won't believe you, won't trust you, or won't want help. That's okay.

#### 4. Patience Pays

Building trust takes time. The best clients often come from persistent, respectful follow-up.
