# Chapter 10: Door Knocking Strategies

## Face-to-Face Connection

Door knocking is the most personal and often most effective way to reach potential clients. While it requires more effort, the face-to-face connection builds trust faster than any other method.

## When Door Knocking Makes Sense

### Best Situations for Door Knocking

✅ **Local leads**: Within reasonable driving distance
✅ **High-value surplus**: Worth the time investment ($15,000+)
✅ **Unreachable by phone/mail**: No response to other methods
✅ **Complex situations**: Need to explain in person
✅ **Heir claims**: Sensitive situations benefit from personal touch

### When to Skip Door Knocking

❌ **Out of area**: Too far to be efficient
❌ **Small surplus amounts**: Not worth the time
❌ **Already responsive**: Phone/mail is working
❌ **Unsafe areas**: Trust your instincts

- Wait 30-60 seconds

**Step 2: When Door Opens**

- Smile warmly
- Keep hands visible
- Maintain comfortable distance
- Make eye contact

**Step 3: Opening Statement**

```
"Hi, are you [First Name]?"

[If yes]

"My name is [Your Name]. I apologize for showing up
unannounced, but I have some good news about your
former property at [Address].

Do you have just a minute? I promise this isn't a
sales pitch—there's actually money that belongs to you."
```

## Door Knocking Scripts

### Script 1: Direct Approach

```
"Hi, [First Name]? I'm [Your Name] with [Company Name].

I know this is unexpected, but I'm here because there's
money from your old property at [Address] that belongs
to you. When it was sold, it sold for more than what
was owed.

I help people recover these surplus funds. Can I take
two minutes to explain?"
```

### Script 2: Soft Approach

```
"Hi there, I'm looking for [First Name]?"

[If confirmed]

"I'm [Your Name]. I tried calling and sending a letter,
but I wanted to make sure you got the information.

There are surplus funds from your former property that
you're entitled to. I know foreclosure is a difficult
topic, but this is actually good news.

Would you be willing to hear about it?"
```

### Script 3: If Someone Else Answers

```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I'm trying to reach [First Name]
about a financial matter. Is [he/she] available?"

[If not]

"I understand. Could you let [him/her] know I stopped by?
It's regarding surplus funds from a property sale—money
that may belong to [him/her].

Here's my card. It's important [he/she] contacts me."
```

### Script 4: If They're Skeptical

```
"I completely understand your hesitation. Let me leave
you with this information [hand brochure/letter].

You can verify everything I've said by calling [County
Office] at [number]. They'll confirm the surplus exists.

I'm not asking for anything today. Just please look
into this—it's real money that belongs to you.

Here's my card if you have questions."
```
