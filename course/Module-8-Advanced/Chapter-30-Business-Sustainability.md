## The Sustainability Mindset

### Short-Term vs. Long-Term Thinking

| Short-Term Focus      | Long-Term Focus        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Maximize this deal    | Build relationships    |
| Cut corners for speed | Maintain quality       |
| Work more hours       | Build systems          |
| Chase every lead      | Focus on ideal clients |
| Ignore problems       | Address root causes    |

### The Sustainable Business

A sustainable business has:

- Consistent revenue (not feast or famine)
- Systems that work without you
- Happy, retained team members
- Satisfied clients who refer others
- Healthy profit margins

## Financial Sustainability

### Cash Flow Management

**Best practices:**

### Pricing for Sustainability

**Your fee should cover:**

- Direct costs
- Team compensation
- Overhead
- Your salary
- Profit margin (reinvestment)
- Reserve building

**Don't race to the bottom on price.**

### Financial Metrics to Monitor

| Metric                  | Target            | Frequency |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Monthly revenue         | Consistent growth | Monthly   |
| Profit margin           | 50%+              | Monthly   |
| Cash reserves           | 3-6 months        | Monthly   |
| Revenue per employee    | Increasing        | Quarterly |
| Client acquisition cost | Decreasing        | Quarterly |
