# Chapter 6: Qualifying Leads for Maximum Success

## Work Smarter, Not Harder

Not all surplus funds leads are created equal. Learning to quickly qualify leads helps you focus your time and energy on the opportunities most likely to result in signed contracts and successful claims.

## The Lead Qualification Framework

### The SPAM Method

**S - Surplus Amount**
Is the surplus large enough to be worth pursuing?

**P - Person Findable**
Can you locate and contact the rightful claimant?

**A - Authority Clear**
Is it clear who has the right to claim?

**M - Motivation Likely**
Is the person likely to want help claiming?

## Qualifying Factor #1: Surplus Amount

### Minimum Thresholds

| Your Model    | Minimum Surplus | Why                              |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Solo operator | $3,000+         | Your time is valuable            |
| Hybrid model  | $2,000+         | VAs reduce your time investment  |
| High volume   | $1,500+         | Systems make small claims viable |

### Sweet Spot Analysis

**Ideal surplus range: $10,000 - $75,000**

| Surplus Amount   | Pros                          | Cons                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Under $5,000     | Easy to close                 | Low fee, same work        |
| $5,000-$15,000   | Good volume, decent fees      | Competition               |
| $15,000-$50,000  | Great fees, motivated clients | More scrutiny             |
| $50,000-$100,000 | Excellent fees                | May hire attorney instead |
| Over $100,000    | Huge potential                | High competition, complex |

### Red Flags on Amount

❌ Surplus under $1,000 (not worth effort)
❌ Amount seems too good to be true (verify carefully)
❌ Multiple lienholders may reduce actual surplus
❌ Pending claims may have priority

## Qualifying Factor #2: Findability

### Scoring Contact Information

| Data Quality            | Score | Action                     |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| Current phone + address | A     | Priority outreach          |
| Phone OR address only   | B     | Pursue with backup methods |
| Only old address        | C     | Skip trace needed          |
| No information found    | D     | Consider skipping          |
| Confirmed deceased      | F     | Research heirs or skip     |

### Findability Indicators

**Easy to find (prioritize):**

- Still in same area
- Active social media
- Professional/licensed occupation
- Owns other property
- Relatives easy to locate

**Hard to find (deprioritize):**

- Moved out of state
- Common name
- No digital footprint
- Transient history
- No known relatives

---

## Qualifying Factor #3: Clear Authority

### Simple Cases (Prioritize)

✅ **Single owner**: One person on title at foreclosure
✅ **Married couple**: Both on title, still married
✅ **Living owner**: Person is alive and competent

### Complex Cases (Proceed with Caution)

⚠️ **Divorced couple**: May need both signatures or court order
⚠️ **Multiple owners**: All must agree and sign
⚠️ **Owner in bankruptcy**: Trustee may have claim
⚠️ **Owner with judgment liens**: Creditors may have priority

### Problem Cases (Often Skip)

❌ **Deceased owner**: Requires probate, heir identification
❌ **Corporate owner**: May be dissolved, complex
❌ **Owner incarcerated**: Difficult process, limited contact
❌ **Disputed ownership**: Legal battle likely

### Heir Claims - Special Consideration

**When owner is deceased:**

1. Check if probate was filed
2. Identify executor/administrator
3. Determine if heirs are known
4. Assess complexity of estate

**Worth pursuing if:**

- Clear single heir
- Probate already completed
- Large surplus amount
- Heir is easy to locate

## Qualifying Factor #4: Motivation

### High Motivation Indicators

✅ **Recent foreclosure**: Pain is fresh, need money
✅ **Large surplus**: Life-changing amount
✅ **Financial distress signs**: Likely needs the money
✅ **Responsive to initial contact**: Shows interest
✅ **Asked questions**: Engaged in process

### Low Motivation Indicators

❌ **Wealthy/high income**: May not care about surplus
❌ **Very old foreclosure**: May have moved on
❌ **Previous bad experience**: Distrustful
❌ **Already contacted by competitors**: May be overwhelmed

### Motivation Assessment Questions

When you reach someone, assess motivation by asking:

- "Were you aware there might be money from your foreclosure?"
- "Would recovering this money be helpful to you right now?"
- "Have you looked into claiming this yourself?"
