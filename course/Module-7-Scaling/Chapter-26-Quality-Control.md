## Pillar 2: Monitoring

**Monitoring spreadsheet:**

```
| Date | VA | Entries Checked | Errors Found | Accuracy |
|------|-----|-----------------|--------------|----------|
|      |     |                 |              |          |
```

### Call Monitoring

**Call recording:**

- Record all calls (with proper disclosure)

| Month 2 | 2x per week |
| Month 3+ | Weekly (3-5 calls) |

**Call scoring rubric:**

| Criteria             | Points  | Score |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----- |

- 70-79: Needs improvement
- Below 70: Requires intervention

## Pillar 3: Feedback

### Giving Effective Feedback

**The SBI-I Model:**

1. **Situation**: When/where
2. **Behavior**: What they did
3. **Impact**: The result
4. **Improvement**: What to do differently

**Example:**
"On yesterday's call with Mr. Johnson (Situation),
you interrupted him several times while he was
explaining his concerns (Behavior). This made him
defensive and he ended the call (Impact). Next time,
let the prospect finish speaking before responding,
even if there's a pause (Improvement)."

### Feedback Frequency

| Type      | Frequency          | Purpose              |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Real-time | As needed          | Urgent corrections   |
| Daily     | End of day         | Quick wins and fixes |
| Weekly    | 1-on-1 meeting     | Comprehensive review |
| Monthly   | Performance review | Big picture          |

### Feedback Channels

**Immediate feedback:**

- Slack/chat message
- Quick call
- In-person (if applicable)

**Structured feedback:**

- Weekly 1-on-1 meetings
- Written performance notes
- Formal reviews

### Positive Feedback

Don't just focus on problems:

- Recognize good work
- Celebrate wins
- Share positive client feedback
- Public recognition (team meetings)

### Implementing Improvements

**Process improvements:**

2. Create/update training
