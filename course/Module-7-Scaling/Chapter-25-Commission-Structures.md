## Compensation Philosophy

### Principles of Good Compensation

1. **Fair**: Competitive with market rates
2. **Motivating**: Rewards good performance
3. **Aligned**: Team wins when business wins
4. **Sustainable**: Business remains profitable
5. **Clear**: Everyone understands how they're paid
6. **Consistent**: Applied equally across team

### The Balance

```
Too Low Pay = High turnover, poor quality
Too High Pay = Unsustainable, low margins
Right Pay = Motivated team, healthy profits
```

## Designing Your Commission Structure

### Step 1: Know Your Numbers

Calculate for each deal:

- Average fee collected: $7,500
- Direct costs (filing, etc.): $200
- Gross margin: $7,300

### Step 2: Allocate to Roles

Decide what percentage goes to each role:

| Role            | % of Fee | $ Amount   |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Research        | 2%       | $150       |
| Calling/Setting | 3%       | $225       |
| Closing         | 10%      | $750       |
| Claims          | 2%       | $150       |
| Overhead        | 10%      | $750       |
| **Your Profit** | **73%**  | **$5,475** |

### Step 3: Structure the Pay

Convert percentages to compensation:

**Research VA:**

- Hourly: $7/hour × 5 hours = $35
- Bonus per deal: $115
- Total per deal: $150

**Caller:**

- Hourly: $10/hour × 10 hours = $100
- Commission per deal: $125
- Total per deal: $225

**Closer:**

- Commission per deal: $750
- (Or hourly + lower commission)

### Step 4: Test and Adjust

- Monitor profitability
- Get team feedback
- Adjust as needed
- Review quarterly
