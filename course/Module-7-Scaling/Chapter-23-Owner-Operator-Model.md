# Chapter 23: The Owner-Operator Model

## Building a Business You Can Step Back From

The ultimate goal for many entrepreneurs is to build a business that runs without them. This chapter shows you how to structure your surplus funds recovery business so you can supervise rather than do all the work.

## Understanding the Owner-Operator Model

### What It Means

**Traditional Model (You do everything):**

```
You → Research → Outreach → Close → Claims → Get Paid
```

**Owner-Operator Model (You supervise):**

```
You (Supervise)
    ↓
Team → Research → Outreach → Close → Claims → Get Paid
```

### The Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Not limited by your personal time
2. **Freedom**: Work on the business, not in it
3. **Income potential**: Unlimited by your hours
4. **Business value**: Sellable asset
5. **Lifestyle**: More flexibility and control

### The Trade-offs

1. **Lower margin per deal**: Team costs money
2. **Management responsibility**: Must lead people
3. **Quality control**: Must maintain standards
4. **Upfront investment**: Build before you benefit
5. **Different skills needed**: Leadership vs. doing

## The Economics

### Revenue Model

**Example: 5 deals/month at $7,500 average fee**

| Item                 | Amount        |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Gross Revenue        | $37,500       |
| Team Costs           | -$8,000       |
| Tools/Software       | -$500         |
| Marketing/Mail       | -$1,000       |
| Other Expenses       | -$500         |
| **Net Profit**       | **$27,500**   |
| Your Time            | 20 hrs/week   |
| **Effective Hourly** | **$344/hour** |

### Scaling Economics

| Deals/Month | Revenue  | Team Cost | Net Profit |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 2           | $15,000  | $2,000    | $12,000    |
| 5           | $37,500  | $8,000    | $27,500    |
| 10          | $75,000  | $15,000   | $55,000    |
| 20          | $150,000 | $30,000   | $110,000   |
